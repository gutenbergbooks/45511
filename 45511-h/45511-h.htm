  <h2 id='ch01' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter I</span> <br /> <br />IN THE SCHOOLROOM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“Flambeau!”</p>

<p class='c018'>The sound was illusive. Flambeau listened with
every bit of him, his taut, strong body alert with
eagerness. The call might have come from the
landing outside the small salon of Madame la Comtesse,
but it had sounded higher up; the schoolroom,
perhaps, or the nurseries beyond. Flambeau gained
the top of a high staircase with a few leaping bounds,
ran down a corridor, turned a corner, and almost
knocked down his own Marie Josephine, who had
been calling him. He leaped upon her in welcome.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ve been out on the balcony, Flambeau. I called
you from there, for I thought you might be in the
garden.”</p>

<p class='c018'>A voice from a half-open door near them called
sharply, “Marie Josephine, come in and close the
door.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine walked slowly toward a flicker
of light reflected on the wall opposite the schoolroom
door, and went inside, closing the door after
her. Flambeau had come in with her and he walked
somewhat disdainfully toward a table which was
drawn close to a dancing fire in a deep, old-fashioned
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_2' id='Page_2'>2</a></span>
fireplace. The table was covered with bits of
brocade, satin, and gold lace. Two girls sat one
on each side of it, and a short, fat maid sat cross-legged
on a stool at their feet, bending over a piece
of sewing in her lap. When Marie Josephine and
the dog came into the room, the maid stood up and
made a curtsy.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Will you sit in your favorite big chair by the
fire, Little Mademoiselle?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine shook her head for reply, watching
the swift darting of the maid’s needle as she sat
down again and went on with her work. Then she
glanced at her cousin Hortense, who held a piece of
ermine up before her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It will do for the edging of the mantle, will it
not, Proté?” Hortense asked the maid. Without
waiting for an answer, she went on speaking. “I
hoped that Tante would allow us to sew the ruby
in the crown, but she would not consent!” As she
spoke, Hortense looked at Denise, Marie Josephine’s
sister, who sat opposite her.</p>

<p class='c018'>Denise tossed her red-brown curls out of her eyes
and pouted. The pout made her look younger than
her fourteen and a half years.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You’ve made this one crookedly. You must do
another one at once, Proté,” she said, handing the
maid a small black object.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, Mademoiselle,” Proté answered.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_3' id='Page_3'>3</a></span>
“Fasten this cord, please, Proté. It does not
seem to be right the way I have done it!” Hortense
held out another black object to the little maid, who
took it smilingly, with a little bow which made her
black hair, gathered into a huge knob at the back
of her neck, stand out like a big black bun.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine still stood by the fire, Flambeau
beside her. She looked at her brother as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Proté cannot do everything at once,” he said.
He sat in the deep shadow of the window seat at
the far end of the room, his hands clasped about
his knees.</p>

<p class='c018'>Denise smiled at him over her shoulder as she
answered: “You know nothing about these things,
Lisle. You have nothing to do about them, but sit
and look on. All that concerns you regarding them
is that you are to wear the robe and crown at the
De Soignés’ ball!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Ball! You speak as though you were going to
a ball. You are only two years older than Rosanne
and I. There is no reason why we should not have
been invited. I should think they would be ashamed
to leave Rosanne out of it all!” exclaimed Marie
Josephine.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Little Mademoiselle would like, perhaps, to
make a bow for her hair? A rosette of this rose
brocade and a bit of the gold tinsel would become
her,” suggested Proté, tying a neat knot in a corner
of the piece of black cardboard which Hortense had
handed her.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine shook her head. “No, Proté,”
she answered.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'>4</a></span>
Flambeau came up to Denise and nosed at the bits
of ribbon in her lap. Denise gave his head a pat.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Would you not like Flambeau to have a big rose
bow? Greyhounds always look better with bows,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine shook her head listlessly, but
did not speak. A big rose bow would be charming
for Flambeau, a puffy one under his right ear. She
was not invited to the De Soigné party, therefore
she would not appear to be interested in any of the
glittering array on the table. She caught her brother’s
eyes. His head was thrown back against the
dark, carved-oak window settle. He was looking
straight at Marie Josephine, and she saw that he
was smiling. She frowned at him with her straight
black brows, and he frowned back with his straight
fair ones. Marie Josephine’s frown was in earnest,
but her brother’s was in fun.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What a thundercloud! What a dragon! What
an ogress! What a——”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine stopped her brother’s words with
a stamp of her foot. “You are not to say that,
Lisle!” she exclaimed passionately.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Don’t tease her, my cousin. How can you do
it?” reproved Hortense, rising as she spoke and
going over to the fireplace. She laid both hands on
the carved, gilded mantelpiece and stood looking
down at the dancing swirl of blue and gold. Suddenly
she put her face in her hands.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine went up to her and touched her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'>5</a></span>
arm, forgetting her own trouble for the moment.
“What is it, Hortense? Why are you sad?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c018'>Hortense raised her face and smiled. “I’m not
sad, chérie; not this afternoon. It is only that now
everything seems grey and dreadful, and Tante is
unhappy because so many of her friends have gone
away, and because of everything.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“You’ll have the party,” Marie Josephine answered
bitterly.</p>

<p class='c018'>Her cousin put her arm about her for a moment
and gave her a little hug. “You want to go so badly.
I do wish you could; but even if Madame de Soigné
had asked you, Tante would never have allowed you
to go. Twelve and a half doesn’t sound much
younger than fourteen and a half, but it is, you
know,” she said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m always treated like a baby,” Marie Josephine
replied. There was a good deal of truth in her
words. She was small and quiet and shy. She
would not be thirteen until November and that was
three months away.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle came up to the fire, stepping over Flambeau,
who had settled himself in the heat of the blaze,
and pinched Marie Josephine’s ear.</p>

<p class='c018'>Proté came up to him with a collar of fluted gold
tinsel and ermine. “Will you allow me to see if it
fits properly, Monsieur Lisle?” she asked, putting
her funny, plump face on one side as she examined
her handiwork.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'>6</a></span>
“No, I’ll not be bothered with frills to-day.”
Lisle frowned this time in earnest, rubbing his
shoulders restlessly against the side of the mantel
and looking out of the window where dark trees
tossed against a grey, stormy sky.</p>

<p class='c018'>Hortense and Denise both spoke at once. “Lisle!”
they exclaimed. Denise jumped up and came over
to him, dragging a piece of blue velvet after her and
unmindful of the fact that a piece of black cardboard
was sticking to her chin. They all burst out laughing
as she clasped her hands together and burst into
a torrent of words.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Lisle, you’re not going to be obstinate. You are
going to be the Sun King at the ball, aren’t you?”
she pleaded.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle shrugged his shoulders, saying teasingly:
“We shall see. I’ll not go with you if you do not
clean your face. A nice, grown-up duchess you
will make, with paste and black paper on your chin.
I for one think it’s all nonsense. It’s stupid of the
De Soigné to have a party now.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle was tall, and he held his blond head high,
which made him look even taller and older than he
was. He would not be sixteen until the following
winter. He had a very fair face with a pointed nose
and blue eyes which had a straight unwinking way
of looking at one. His cousin Hortense, who had
lived in his family since her infancy, was almost as
tall as he, but she was dark, like Marie Josephine.
Strangers always took them for sisters.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'>7</a></span>
“I think it’s splendid of the De Soigné to have
the party!” Denise danced mockingly in front of
her brother as she spoke. He had consented to
allow Proté to try on the collar, but he stood frowning
over her shoulder as she surveyed the effect.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some one came in quickly from the nurseries
beyond. It was a short, sharp-nosed woman in a
black silk dress with wide, flowing sleeves and a
fichu of lace at the neck. This was Madame le Pont,
the governess.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There you are, chérie. I have been uneasy
because I could not find you. Surely you have not
been in the garden unattended!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I wasn’t in the garden. I was out on the balcony
listening,” Marie Josephine answered.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Listening! What do you mean?” the governess
asked her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The noises of Paris, Madame. There are so
many noises now. Flambeau was restless last night.
He heard them, too!”</p>

<p class='c018'>There was a low rap on the door. It opened and
a servant came in. He walked noiselessly about the
room, a taper in his hand, and a moment later lights
flickered and then shone bravely from the many
candles in bronze sockets on the tapestried walls.
The servant made a bright bit of color himself as
he moved about in his trousers of crimson velvet.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Madame la Comtesse wishes the young ladies,
Mademoiselle Hortense and Mademoiselle Denise,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'>8</a></span>
to accompany her in an hour’s time to the house of
Madame la Comtesse de Soigné,” he announced.</p>

<p class='c018'>Denise gave a little laugh of pleasure and danced
the whole length of the room and back again. Then
she caught Flambeau’s forepaws and tried to make
him dance too, but the dog had such a bored expression
that Denise only laughed again and dropped his
paws.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is only Marie Josephine that you love, is it
not, Flambeau?” she exclaimed, and then went on
eagerly: “We shall enjoy talking about the ball
with the dear De Soigné. Proté, I wish to wear
my white cloak in spite of the storm.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am tired of the very name of this ball!” Lisle
walked over to the door as he spoke, but turned as
Denise answered him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We are happy about it because we have had no
fun in such a long time, now that everything is so
different. Maman will not allow us to go out except
in our own garden and to the De Soigné. It is only
because they live in the next square that we may go
there at all,” she said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Maman is foolish!” Lisle exclaimed, and the
governess admonished him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Monsieur Lisle!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is true, Madame le Pont. There is no real
danger, not here in Paris. It is 1792, not the dark
ages. Help will come from the royalists in Europe.
It is only a question of being patient. It is not really
a revolution, you know!”</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'>9</a></span>
Marie Josephine watched her brother with admiration
as he spoke. How tall and brave and
confident he was!</p>

<p class='c018'>The governess smiled sadly but she was cheerful
enough when she spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Come at once, Mesdemoiselles,” she said briskly.
“Proté, tell Felice that the young ladies wish their
coiffures done at once, and see to their mantles and
hats yourself.” Then she turned to Lisle, who still
stood lounging against the door.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What will you do while they are away, Monsieur
Lisle?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle smiled in his quiet, teasing way.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m going to ride with my tutor, Madame,” he
answered.</p>

<p class='c018'>Madame le Pont threw up her hands. “Please do
not do it when it so worries Madame your mother.
It makes her afraid when you are so reckless!” she
exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are never to say that my mother is afraid,
if you please, Madame,” Lisle said and, as he spoke,
he opened the door and went out.</p>

<p class='c018'>Madame le Pont went over to the table and stood
fingering the bits of gold lace there. Marie Josephine
watched her. Why had she not been told
that she could go with Hortense and Denise?
Rosanne de Soigné was her greatest chum. They
could have sat quietly in a corner and talked. Marie
Josephine turned toward the nurseries and then
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>10</a></span>
looked back at the governess, who still stood by the
table.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Le Pont is worrying. She is uneasy like maman.
This is a bad time. Grandfather said that it would
come. He said to me: 'Little Marie Josephine, I
can almost see the black clouds, they are so thick
ahead of us. But when they come I shall not be here,
and I am the only one that seems to know they are
drifting toward us!’”</p>

<p class='c018'>The governess looked up and when she looked
at Marie Josephine it was as though she had for
the moment forgotten her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Little one, what will you do while I am away
this afternoon? Proté will amuse you if you like.
Perhaps you will work for a little while on the
tapestry for your great-aunt?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine shook her head vigorously. She
stood thinking for a moment and then smiled up at
the governess.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I won’t be lonely, Madame. I don’t mind them
at all. They may have as many parties as they like.
They may go out for goûter every afternoon. It is
nothing to me. I do not care!” She spoke earnestly
but she knew she was not speaking the truth and the
governess knew it also.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But what will you do, then, all the rest of the
afternoon?” Madame le Pont insisted.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll be thinking of grandfather,” Marie Josephine
answered.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter II</span> <br /> <br />MARIE JOSEPHINE’S SECRET</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Lisle put his head inside the schoolroom door
before starting downstairs for his ride. Marie Josephine
and Flambeau were standing by the window,
and he crossed over to them, his jeweled riding crop
and his gloves in his hand. His bright hair was tied
at the back of his neck with a crisp, black ribbon.
Marie Josephine turned toward him when she heard
his footsteps.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ve been watching from the window. Le Pont
is walking with maman in front and the girls are
behind them, with Neville following. Why does
not Georges go with them? Does he not always
accompany maman?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Georges has gone. He left our household early
this morning. He is all for the people and has no
longer any use for our kind. He is wise to go, for
his neck is safer away from us than with us!” Lisle
laughed down at her as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine put her arm about Flambeau’s
neck and looked at her brother.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I don’t quite know what you mean, Lisle,” she
said.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>12</a></span>
“I mean that Georges would rather be where he
can talk with people in the streets and make trouble,”
Lisle answered, but he looked almost as puzzled as
his sister. He was fifteen and the head of his house,
but he had never been taught to think things out
for himself. He had hardly ever been alone in all
his life, for when he rode or walked a tutor had
always been with him. He had fenced and danced
and shot, had studied about the old kings and the
exploits of his own ancestors, but, like Marie Josephine,
he only vaguely understood what really was
going on in Paris.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I want to go to Pigeon Valley, Lisle. I don’t
like the sounds at night,” Marie Josephine said.
She wanted to ask about the blue velvet and ermine
and the crown but she could not make up her mind
to do it.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle pulled her cherry-colored rosette. He had
come back because he had teased her. She knew
this and she suddenly put her head down on his arm.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I wish I could go to the bal masqué, Lisle. It’s
going to be so wonderful,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is silly nonsense; that’s what it is! Madame
de Soigné is giving the party for Cécile and Bertran.
The fat Bertran needs a good caning instead of a
bal masqué. He knows I know he cheated at fencing
last week. It is a foolish time to have a soirée when
everything in the city is upside down!” Lisle answered
her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Maman said to Le Pont, 'There is no longer any
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_13' id='Page_13'>13</a></span>
pleasure for us now that the king and queen are in
such danger, but let the children enjoy themselves
while they may.’ I did not overhear her. She said
it before us all here in the schoolroom.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, maman fears always for the queen. Well,
I must be off. Monsieur Laurent is waiting.” He
lifted Marie Josephine’s chin and looked at her.
“You are an odd little mortal. You are like grandfather.”
Then he crossed the room and, looking
back at her from the doorway, said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll tell you all about the silly party after it is
over.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“The same night—as soon as you come home, no
matter how late it is?” she called across the room
excitedly.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle nodded. It was a long room and she looked
such a little figure sitting there on the broad window
sill. He was right. She was like their grandfather.</p>

<p class='c018'>She listened until his footsteps had died away.
Proté was in the housekeeper’s room having a good
gossip. She and Flambeau were alone.</p>

<p class='c018'>She settled back in the corner of the window sill,
Flambeau at her feet. She liked being there alone,
and she felt sleepy and comfortable. She was thinking
of her grandfather and of the spring afternoon
two years before when they had had the adventure.
She had often sat with him while he read or wrote
and on that particular day she had found him looking
at her in his sad, wistful way. The others had
gone for a drive with Madame le Pont. The servants,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>14</a></span>
except for the footmen on duty in the lower
hall, were in their own part of the house, so they
were quite alone. She had been sitting in the chair
with the fawn and tiger coat of arms of the Saint
Frères emblazoned in gold at the top of it.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You have l’esprit, little Marie,” he had said.
“You are the one who will think and understand and
you are the one of this generation who will know
how to help. I have a secret to tell you and something
to show you. Promise me first that you will
keep this afternoon locked up in your heart. Do not
breathe of it to any soul unless the time should come
when by so doing you feel that you will be of service
to those you hold dear. Do you understand?”
Grandfather had risen and come over to her as he
spoke. “Do you understand, my child, that, after I
am gone, except for one other, you are the only one
who will know of what I am to show you and tell
you?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Who is the other one, grandfather?” she had
asked, all afire with eager interest.</p>

<p class='c018'>Grandfather had shaken his head. “Do not concern
yourself with that, little one. Be grateful that
from them all I have chosen you. I am taking you
down into the heart of the earth, Marie. I am going
to tell you the legend of your house.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Flambeau barked suddenly and fiercely, his feet
on the window seat, his eager eyes intent on something
which had caught his interest in the garden
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>15</a></span>
below. His bark brought Marie Josephine back to
the present with a start. She jumped to her feet.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Come, Flambeau, we’ll go down to the cellar,”
she said. She ran across the room and the dog
followed her with graceful bounds. When they
reached the staircase, Marie Josephine leaned over
the banister and listened, and Flambeau stopped and
listened too. At the top of the first flight of stairs
they both stopped and listened again. There was
not a sound in the great house.</p>

<p class='c018'>The next staircase was steep and they had to be
cautious. Marie Josephine felt along the side of
the rough stone wall as they walked, and she placed
one foot before the other very carefully on the
uneven hollows of the stone steps. It was a long
way down to the cellars. They stopped to rest
several times and welcomed the flare of a taper set
in the wall at the bottom of the stairs. A damp,
musty odor greeted them and a gusty wind blew
about them.</p>

<p class='c018'>All along one side of the cellar were shelves on
which were jars of the good fig jam made by Mother
Barbette at Les Vignes, the Saint Frères’ summer
home in Pigeon Valley. Barrels of apples and potatoes
stood in dusky corners. Marie Josephine went
over to the shelves and sniffed at the jam. Then
she spoke to Flambeau.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I want to see Mother Barbette, Flambeau. I
want to see Jean and Dian and Pince Nez, the crow.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>16</a></span>
I want our home, Les Vignes. The lilies will be in
bloom all along the south terrace.”</p>

<p class='c018'>She sat down on the lowest step of the cellar stairs
and put her chin on her hand, shaking her dark ringlets
away from her face. A rat scudded all the way
along a rafter above her head, making a queer,
squeaking noise as he did so. Marie Josephine had
seen him before, or at any rate one of his kind. He
was a part of the expedition and the fun. She liked
sitting there in the gloom, with Flambeau’s head
against her knee, the silence of the house above her,
and below her the secret! The cellars had been just
as dusky and mysterious two years ago as they were
to-day. Flambeau’s feet had scraped the same way
against the stone floor. The only difference was
that she was now almost thirteen and that grandfather
had died!</p>

<p class='c018'>She stood up and went quickly across to a far
corner of the cellar, Flambeau following her. She
knelt down near a pile of sacks filled with potatoes,
and felt along the cold floor. Still leaning on the
floor with one hand, she gave Flambeau’s head a
little pat with the other.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are not to be afraid, you know, Flambeau.
No Saint Frère is ever afraid. Grandfather said
so; and you are one of the family you know, Flambeau!”</p>

<p class='c018'>She felt carefully along the floor. She knew well
that it was the seventh stone square from the corner
that she wanted, and she found it easily, in spite of
the shadowy, uncertain light from the torch by the
stairs. Then she spoke again to Flambeau.</p>
<div id='illus03' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic004'>
<img src='images/illus-033.jpg' alt='Drawing of Flambeau' class='ig004' />
<p><i>Flambeau</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'>17</a></span>
“This is the stone. It will open, you know. It
always does, even though it never seems as though
it really could. No one knows about it but you and
me and the other one.”</p>

<p class='c018'>She put her head sideways so that it rested for a
moment on Flambeau’s upturned face, and she felt
the eager response of a warm, rough tongue. Then
she leaned over again, putting her palm on the center
of the seventh stone, and pressing down upon it.
At the same time she laid her other hand on the
upper left side of the stone and pushed away from
herself, and slowly and noiselessly it slid aside, disclosing
a long, steep, ladderlike flight of stairs,
leading down into what might have been the innermost
depths of the earth!</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine reached down to the right into
the dark, yawning, square hole and lifted out a small
iron lanthorn which rested on a ledge just underneath
the stone panel. Then she struck the flint
against the tinder, opened the lanthorn’s squeaky
little lid, and lit the wick. A bright blue flame shot
up at once, and, when she had shut the wee door,
settled to a steady flame. She turned around and
began to descend backward, resting the lanthorn
on each step as she went down. When she had gone
down several steps, she called softly to the dog, and
he followed, facing her, putting one strong, slender
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>18</a></span>
foot in front of the other, with slow, unerring
precision.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a long, slow descent, and as they went
farther and farther into the musty gloom, a chill
closeness enveloped them. Finally they reached the
last step and found themselves on another stone
floor, more uneven than the floor above, one that
seemed to hold the echoes of the ages.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a large room into which they had come
and there was the grey glimmer of rooms beyond.
The walls were rough hewn, and trickles of water
faintly edged their way through the massive stones.
There was an astonishing air of homelikeness about
the strange place. A huge red rug hung against one
side of the wall, and above a great carved chest at
the other end was a tapestry of the crusaders. The
rug, though old, was still in good condition. It had
been hung there by a Saint Frère just three generations
back, but the tapestry had been there much
longer, so long that it seemed a part of the ancient
place. Near the ladderlike stairs was a long stone
shelf and it shone and gleamed in the light from
the lanthorn.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine sat down on the chest and leaned
her head against the rough wall. The whole adventure
of coming to the secret cellar was enthralling,
but the most wonderful part of it was sitting there
and thinking of Lisle Saint Frère, her oldest ancestor,
he who had laid the first stone of this ancient
place and whose one thought had been always to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>19</a></span>
help others and to serve the right. As she sat there
she felt the tears smarting in her eyes. She was
thinking of her grandfather too. She fancied that
she could see him walking up and down, a slight
figure in his black velvet breeches and long coat, the
brilliants shining on his pointed shoes, his delicate
hands clasped together, the soft frills of lace falling
over them. Yet it was not so much of him that she
was thinking as of what he had said to her:</p>

<p class='c018'>“It all began so long ago. This house is not like
other houses, Marie. You know that well; all of
you do. It is not just an old house like that of your
Great-aunt Hortense, or of the De Soignés, or of
others of our friends. This house is ancient, Marie.
It is medieval! It was standing here when Lisle
Saint Frère, your oldest ancestor, was brought home
mortally wounded, and that is farther back than
even your fancy can take you, little one—almost as
long ago as the time of Charlemagne and the Song
of Roland! It was built in the time of knights at
arms. It was the idea of that first Lisle Saint Frère,
and it was he who laid its first stone, he who became
the bravest knight of his time in all France. He
was the best one of us that ever lived. There has
never been another who was so good.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Except you, grandfather,” she had said stoutly,
and as she sat there in the dim stillness, she remembered
that his face had lightened at her words. But
he had answered her earnestly:</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am poor indeed in the little I have done for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>20</a></span>
my brother man, Marie. I have dreamed—just
dreamed. I have wanted to help, but I have not
known how. In each generation one of us has
wanted to help, has been weighed down by the
misery of those upon our lands. There is a time
coming, mark me well, Marie, when the old days
shall be at an end, when new ways of freedom shall
sweep the old régime away. You will live to see
that day. Be strong, Marie. There is not a young
lamb at Pigeon Valley that you do not love. There
is not a human being whom you could not love.
You will see beyond the tinsel and the satin. You
are the truest descendant of Lisle Saint Frère.”</p>

<p class='c018'>She had protested, “Lisle is the truest, grandfather!”</p>

<p class='c018'>He had answered: “Lisle is too proud. I have
brought you to this secret cellar which has sheltered
your ancestors in peril. No one has ever known of
it except one of our family in every generation and
one other who is outside the family. Keep it a secret
unless the time should come when by disclosing it
you can help some one in need. Meanwhile, be glad
that you are the one of this generation to know!”</p>

<p class='c018'>She began to be sleepy as she sat on the chest,
thinking of all that her grandfather had told her,
wondering who the “other one” could be. She
jumped up, called Flambeau, and slowly and carefully
they made their way up the steep, ladderlike
stairs. A grey gleam of light greeted them through
the open secret panel. Flambeau scrambled up on to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>21</a></span>
the cellar floor after Marie Josephine and watched
her, his nose quivering with interest, as she shut
the panel.</p>

<p class='c018'>She knelt there for a minute thinking of the old
green lanthorn which she had put out and so carefully
placed on its ledge under the secret stone, of
the hidden room itself, and of the Lisle Saint Frère
who had helped to build it with his own mailed
hands. Last of all she thought of her grandfather
and of the honor he had done her in letting her be
the Saint Frère of her generation to know the secret.
Then, suddenly, she remembered that her dancing
master was to come at five. She brushed the cobwebs
from her wide skirts and climbed up from the
sombre cellar to the stately spaciousness of her home.</p>

  <h2 id='ch03' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter III</span> <br /> <br />THE BAL MASQUÉ</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“You need not worry at all, Proté. No one will
know. It will be quite easy. Gonfleur is waiting at
the door. You have said yourself that Mademoiselle
Marie Josephine should not miss the fun.”</p>

<p class='c018'>A small figure in a white cloak was following the
little maid up a stairway leading from a side garden
door of the Saint Frère house as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Mademoiselle may not be asleep. She often lies
awake these nights. It is indeed a shame that she
should not have gone with the others. But you,
Mademoiselle, will they miss you?”</p>

<p class='c018'>They were outside the nursery door as Rosanne
de Soigné answered. She looked up at Proté and
spoke indignantly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“They think that I am asleep in bed with some
silly bonbons under my pillow. It is the same with
me as with Marie Josephine; they treat me as though
I were a child. To-night I have an idea! You will
hear me tell Mademoiselle!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Proté opened the door leading to a small room
off the day nursery which was Marie Josephine’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>23</a></span>
own apartment. She was not asleep, and as they
came into the room she sat up in bed and said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“What is it, Proté? What has happened?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Nothing has happened, Mademoiselle, except
that your friend, Mademoiselle Rosanne de Soigné,
has come to see you,” Proté replied, lighting a candle
as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanne came up to the bed and, before Marie
Josephine, in her bewilderment, could speak, said
eagerly:</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are to come with me, Marie Josephine.
Proté is to dress you at once. You shall not be left
out of the ball. Listen! I know a place where we
can see it all, watch the dancing, and hear the music!
Gonfleur is to bring us goûter when the others are
having theirs. It will be the greatest fun!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine was so surprised for a moment
that she could not speak.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Hurry, for we must not miss any of it. Proté
has your stockings. Let her put them on,” urged
Rosanne.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine stuck out her foot obediently,
and Proté, kneeling beside her, pulled on the stockings,
muttering to herself distressfully:</p>

<p class='c018'>“This is dreadful. What if Madame la Comtesse
should know! May the good saints protect
me if Madame should find us out!”</p>

<p class='c018'>When Proté said this, Marie Josephine seemed
to wake up to the situation and, leaning over, patted
the round knob at the back of the little maid’s head.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>24</a></span>
“You are a foolish girl, Proté. Have you not
raged to me and to Monsieur Lisle because I was
not invited? You even spoke to Le Pont. I heard
you say to her, 'They must have been selfish indeed
to have so forgotten the Little Mademoiselle!’”</p>

<p class='c018'>While Marie Josephine was speaking, Proté was
putting on her little silken undergarments, fastening
the tapes which tied them with nervous fingers. Then
she slipped a light silk frock over her head and put
a blue cape about her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Come, Mesdemoiselles, I will escort you to Gonfleur.
I shall be waiting for you at the garden door
when the clock strikes ten, Little Mademoiselle.
You must be in bed and asleep before Madame la
Comtesse and the others return,” admonished Proté.</p>

<p class='c018'>They had come out to the upper landing and they
stood for a moment looking down into the great
hall below. A man servant in red and white livery
was passing through the hall. He stooped and extinguished
the candles, until at last only a tall one
in a high, golden candlestick on a marble table near
the door was left burning.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We must go down the other way. It would not
do for the servants to know. One cannot be too
careful in these bad times,” whispered Proté as they
walked down a long hall, lit dimly by flaring candles
in bronze sockets.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was a light patter of steps behind them
and turning they saw that Flambeau was following
them. Proté shook her stubby finger at him, whispering
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>25</a></span>
in a hissing sort of way that made her voice
sound almost like a whistle in the gusty corridor.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Ah, the bad dog! You are to go back at once
to Mademoiselle’s room. You are not to follow!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine and Rosanne giggled, and Flambeau
came forward slowly, in spite of Proté’s upraised
hand and threatening looks.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You know that he will come, as he goes everywhere
with us. There is no use to urge him to go
back.” Rosanne pulled impatiently at Proté’s arm
as she spoke. The little maid only raised her hands
as though in despair, and the four of them started
to descend the steep flight of stairs. The two girls
were both laughing softly with excitement, holding
each other’s hands and looking back at Flambeau.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine knew this staircase well, but she
said nothing. No one must know that she had ever
been down these stairs before, because they were a
part of grandfather’s secret.</p>

<p class='c018'>An old man was waiting for them at the door
leading into the garden. It was Gonfleur, the servant
who had come with Rosanne. He held a lighted
lanthorn in one hand and when he saw Proté and
the children, he started to shuffle slowly along the
path ahead of them, holding the lanthorn carefully
so that they could see their way.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We are both fools, you an old one and I a young
one, Gonfleur. See that you return with Mademoiselle
Marie Josephine at ten exactly, or it will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>26</a></span>
the worse for you!” Proté called after him in her
funny, hissing way.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gonfleur made no reply and, holding open the
heavy garden door, let his two charges through and
then followed them. They found themselves on the
walk outside, the sultry dampness of an August night
all about them. The roar of the city could be heard
in the distance and from the corner came the sound
of rough laughter and harsh voices. They turned
away in the opposite direction from the voices and,
as it was only a very little way to the iron door
leading to the back entrance to the De Soigné mansion,
they found themselves shut away from the
street soon again, almost before they knew it.</p>

<p class='c018'>It had been exciting to them both, that little walk
through the night. Neither of them had ever been
out this way before. Marie Josephine had never
seen the city after sundown but once, and that was
when, because of some trouble with their horses,
they had been delayed in coming back from Pigeon
Valley, where they spent their summers, and their
coach had not entered Paris until evening. That
had been the summer before.</p>

<p class='c018'>When once they were inside the little door leading
to the vast back quarters of the great mansion, there
was no longer any need of Gonfleur’s lanthorn to
light them, for all the way up the winding stairs
were flaring torches. At the foot of the stairs the
old servant bowed and left them. Rosanne called
after him.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'>27</a></span>
“You are not to forget to come with the sweets,
Gonfleur!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I will remember, of a surety, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p class='c018'>They were so far from the region of the bal
masqué that only the faintest sound of music came
to them. Rosanne took her friend’s hand and they
climbed up the steep stairs side by side. Marie
Josephine knew where they were going or at least
she guessed. It was the place above all others where
she liked best to play. It was a little square balcony
in the wall at the very tiptop of the house and one
could reach it by this back flight of stairs. The two
children had discovered it some years ago and, on
the rare occasions when they were left to themselves,
they had climbed up to it and looked down into the
vastness of the great hall below.</p>

<p class='c018'>The music of a minuet was being played as the
two settled themselves in a corner of the balcony
and looked down. The minuet music was very
pretty, and the sight upon which they gazed was
pretty, too.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is like maman’s picture of which she is so fond—the
picture where all the people are dancing. It
is by Monsieur Watteau. Grandfather told me so,”
whispered Marie Josephine.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is no need at all for whispering,” Rosanne
answered in natural tones. “No one could hear us
if we were to shout ever so loud!”</p>

<p class='c018'>They sat close together because they felt a little
cold. Drifts of chill air came in from behind them.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>28</a></span>
It seemed as though even in mid-summer there was
always a breath of dampness at the De Soignés’.</p>

<p class='c018'>Below them the many-colored throng moved
through the dainty measures of the dance. The
sound of laughter and young voices blended with
the sweet strains of the music. It seemed like fairyland
to the two who looked down on it.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We can only guess who they are until they take
off their masks, but I think that fat one in the red
mantle is my cousin Bertran du Monde,” Rosanne
said, leaning far over and peering around the corner,
as she tried to follow the figure of a boy in red.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine looked too.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, that is Bertran. What a fat, funny boy he
is! Do you remember how he teased us the afternoon
that he came to tea with us all in our schoolroom?
He is a stupid boy. You do not mind my
saying that even if he is your cousin, do you?” Marie
Josephine laughed mischievously as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanne laughed happily.</p>

<p class='c018'>“No, it is true. He is a stupid, fat boy, and he
is often very rude. See, is that not your cousin
Hortense, the tall girl dancing with——?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine interrupted her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s Lisle, Hortense and Lisle. She is almost
as tall as he is and she is only fifteen. She looks
so very grown-up. How happy I should be if I
could dance the minuet with Lisle! He always thinks
me such a baby!”</p>
<div id='illus04' class='figcenter'>

<p><i>Lisle</i></p>

</div>
<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>29</a></span>
There was a little choke in Marie Josephine’s
voice as she said this, and she looked down very
wistfully at the fun going on in the great banquet
hall.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The fruit and bonbons and the eau sucré are in
the small room at the right. They will be going in
there very soon after dancing for refreshment.
Gonfleur has promised to bring us sweets and he will
not forget. He is very good.” Rosanne lowered
her voice a little though there was really no need.
The music had stopped and gay, chattering groups
walked slowly about or went on, as Rosanne had
prophesied, to the room beyond.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine did not answer. She was deep
in thought, her chin wedged in between the carved
wooden spokes of the tiny balcony. How wonderful
to be down there in the midst of all the glitter of
lights and jewels, gold lace and flowers, and to have
Lisle for her partner, Lisle in his blue velvet and
brilliants!</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanne’s quick eyes looked here and there. Her
one desire was to discover her friends and cousins
among the gay throng below. She agreed with
Marie Josephine that they had found Bertran, but
was not so sure about his sister Cécile.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Cécile would not let me see her beforehand. She
did not come in with the others when they bade me
good night. She knows about the balcony. I told
her I’d be here and she thought it the greatest fun.
She said she would do her best to see me and let me
see her. She said she would come right underneath
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>30</a></span>
me if she could and that she would look up. Then
I could tell that it was she. You see I don’t know
what her costume is at all.” As she spoke, Rosanne
moved a little so that Flambeau could wedge himself
in next to her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Did you tell Cécile that you were coming with
Gonfleur to get me?” whispered Marie Josephine.
She could not help whispering; it made it all seem
more exciting.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanne shook her head. “No, I didn’t dare to
do that. She would have been worried. Oh, she
would have begged me not to go. Why, no one
would think of such a thing, Marie Josephine; no
one would ever believe I’d go out alone with just
a servant at night!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“It was a splendid thing to do, and I’ll not forget
it,” answered Marie Josephine warmly. Then, with
Flambeau’s head upon her knee, she sat quietly
looking down. The music of a gavotte had begun
and it was like a ripple of laughter. It made Marie
Josephine think of Pigeon Valley and her home, Les
Vignes.</p>

<p class='c018'>They had always spent their summers at Les
Vignes until this year. Marie Josephine had often
heard the governess say: “We must thank God for
Les Vignes, children. It is a refuge from all trouble.”
Marie Josephine knew that there had been fighting
in the streets, and that many of their friends had
left France. Her maman no longer went out to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_31' id='Page_31'>31</a></span>
grand soirées. There was sadness and restlessness
everywhere.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But I am happy to-night. Everyone is happy,”
she thought. She had often heard Hortense and
Denise anticipating the wonder of their first ball.
They would wear the family jewels. It would be
the grandest affair! Well, they had three years to
wait. This was small in comparison to what that
gala ball would be! This was just a handful of
boys and girls in costumes made up for the moment
by governesses and servants. There were bad times
in the city. The people had imprisoned the king,
Louis XVI, and the queen, Marie Antoinette, in the
Tuileries palace.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Things are always happening, but to-night they
are happy things,” Marie Josephine said to Rosanne,
and by way of answer, her friend said excitedly:</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is Cécile, all in white! She’s holding out
her silver wand as she dances. See! She’s looking
up at us and smiling, though she cannot see us. It
is too dark up here, and we are too far away.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I love Cécile better than any one except maman
and Lisle and grandfather and Dian and you,”
Marie Josephine answered solemnly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Not better than your own sister!” exclaimed
Rosanne in shocked tones.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine nodded. “Yes, better than
Denise. Cécile is like a maiden in a fairy tale,
Denise isn’t.”</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>32</a></span>
“Listen. Is that not Gonfleur coming up the
stairs? He is bringing the goûter,” said Rosanne.</p>

<p class='c018'>The girls peered down through the little door at
the back of the balcony and after a moment Gonfleur
turned a bend and came toward them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“How fast he is climbing! I did not know his
malady, the rheumatism, would permit him to go
so fast!” exclaimed Marie Josephine.</p>

<p class='c018'>When he came a little nearer Rosanne called softly
to him:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Good Gonfleur, you have come with sweets for
us. You do well to hurry!”</p>

<p class='c018'>The old man puffed for a moment as he reached
the top step. Then he picked up Marie Josephine’s
cloak from the back of the chair and began to put
it around her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are to come at once, Mademoiselle—at
once, if you please, at once,” he muttered as he tied
the ribbons at her throat with trembling fingers.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What are you doing, Gonfleur? Mademoiselle
Saint Frère is not to go home until we have had the
sweets. Where are they? Do not hurry so!”
Rosanne put her hand on Gonfleur’s arm and shook
it. “Do not say that it has been discovered that
she came here to-night,” she went on.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gonfleur shook his head. “There is need of haste.
The Little Mademoiselle cannot stay longer. No,
she is not found out. It is not that. Would to the
kind God is was only that, Mademoiselle. It is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>33</a></span>
a good night to be out.” Gonfleur stood shaking
his head, still trembling as he answered.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Not a good night. What can you mean! It is
a beautiful night. Do you not see how splendid it
is downstairs and how happy we all are?” Rosanne
frowned and spoke impatiently, holding on to Marie
Josephine’s cape. “You shall not take her away so
soon. She shall have the sweets and fruit before
she goes.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is not happy outside, Mademoiselle Rosanne,”
Gonfleur answered. Then turning to Marie Josephine,
he said: “We will go back as we came, Mademoiselle.
It is only a step to your portal where
Proté will be waiting, but we must not delay. I
entreat you, Mademoiselle, not to delay.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Gonfleur spoke so earnestly and seemed so uneasy
that the two girls were impressed. There seemed
nothing else to do but for Marie Josephine to go
with him at once. The two friends kissed each other
on each cheek and then, her hand in Gonfleur’s
and with Flambeau at her heels, Marie Josephine
went down the long, steep stairs. On the first landing
she turned and looked back at Rosanne, who
stood in the dusk of the red velvet lined balcony
looking down at her, her fair hair falling about her
shoulders. Marie Josephine waved her hand and
Rosanne waved back.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gonfleur’s lanthorn was already lit, and it stood
on an iron ledge by the door leading from the foot
of the stairs to the courtyard of the great house.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>34</a></span>
The court was deserted and they crossed it quickly,
Gonfleur holding his charge’s hand firmly, and not
once letting it go except for the moment when he
unlocked the door leading from the court to the
street. Marie Josephine was indignant with him
for hurrying her away in such a fashion in the midst
of the fun and before the sweets were served. She
would have insisted on staying and would have told
Gonfleur to wait until it was her pleasure to go, if
her own position had not been an uncertain one. She
had never done anything so daring before.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gonfleur shut the door quickly behind them and
they turned to the left, crossed the street, and found
themselves at the side portal of the Saint Frère house
before they knew it. As they stood for a moment
in front of the door while Gonfleur fumbled with
the lock in his near-sighted way, the loud clatter of
horses’ hoofs rang out sharply in the confused night
air. Marie Josephine looked back over her shoulder
as they turned into the garden. She saw a squad
of mounted soldiers rush by at full speed and disappear
in a flash down a side street to the right.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gonfleur muttered to himself as he pushed her
gently along the garden path. Proté was waiting
at the door and Marie Josephine was glad to see
her. Proté took her hand and squeezed it and Marie
Josephine squeezed back.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Put Mademoiselle to bed at once. There is
rough work to-night. Hear that!” They stood
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'>35</a></span>
still and listened. There was a dull, heavy booming
sound. Proté raised her hands.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Cannon; and it’s the Tuileries. Neville told me
a half hour ago that there were wild doings to-night.
I’ll take care of Mademoiselle, never fear. Now
get you home, Gonfleur. The others will be coming
when they know there’s trouble.” As she spoke
Proté shut the door and bolted it. Then she and
Marie Josephine and Flambeau climbed the stairs
as quickly as they could.</p>

<p class='c018'>Proté’s fingers flew in undressing Marie Josephine
and very soon she was tucked in her big bed. She
lay awake a little while thinking of the music and
the dancing and how lovely Rosanne’s cousin Cécile
had looked in her white and silver frock and with
her hair powdered.</p>

<p class='c018'>“She seemed really grown-up, not pretending like
Hortense and Denise, yet she is only fifteen. I saw
the party anyway. What would Lisle and the girls
say if they knew! I am nearly thirteen and they
treat me like a baby. I am not a baby. I think more
than Denise and I read many books that she does
not know about at all, and I know about things too,
battles and poems and old, old days that grandfather
told me about. I’m not young at all, really I——”
She was asleep!</p>

<p class='c018'>When she awoke it was still dark. Flambeau’s
cold nose was touching her arm and Lisle was sitting
on the edge of her bed. In her astonishment she
sat up and stared at him. He had thrown back the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>36</a></span>
blue velvet, ermine-trimmed mantle that he had worn
at the ball, and had unsheathed his jeweled sword.
It glowed like a live thing on the whiteness of the
satin counterpane. In the light from a flaring socket
just outside the open door, his white face, fair hair,
and the gleaming crystals on his costume shone in
the summer darkness.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine touched his arm. “Lisle, why
are you here?” she asked. “Isn’t it the middle of
the night?” She shook the curls from her eyes,
shivering a little in the midnight cold.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I was just sitting here. I’m sorry you woke up,
but now that you are awake I will tell you something.
You are to leave for Pigeon Valley at six in the
morning, you and Hortense and Denise, and of
course Madame le Pont and Proté,” Lisle said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“And Flambeau?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle shrugged his shoulders. “The dog goes
everywhere with you. Bertran du Monde is going
too, and his servant. They will ride by the coach.
Bertran will be staying at Les Vignes with you.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Bertran du Monde! But he is not your great
friend. You will not want him as a companion.
Why does he go?” Marie Josephine was bewildered
and not yet quite awake. It all seemed like a dream
to her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am not going with you.”</p>

<p class='c018'>What was it Lisle was saying? His sister grabbed
his arm and shook it.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Don’t tease me. You always go to Les Vignes,”
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>37</a></span>
she said, but she felt that he meant what he had
said and knew in her heart that he was not teasing.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am telling you the truth. You are going at
six just as I have said. A rider has gone ahead
to-night to prepare the servants at Les Vignes. You
are to be quiet and obedient and are not to sulk.”
Lisle spoke sternly but he did not frighten his sister
at all. She put her arm about his shoulders and
laid her face close to his. He did not return her
caress, but sat looking straight in front of him.
Marie Josephine sat back against her pillows, winking
her eyes rapidly to keep the tears back. When
she had put her cheek close to her brother’s she had
felt something wet. It had been a tear. She must
never let him know. He would never forgive her
if he found it out.</p>

<p class='c018'>“When are you coming?” she asked a little
timidly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I don’t know. I shall not leave maman.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“You mean because of all the noise and shooting
and trouble and keeping the king and queen in
prison,” asked Marie Josephine.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle nodded. “Maman will not go. She says
it would be disloyal. She is right. If it is disloyal
for her, it is disloyal for me. But we will talk no
more to-night. Then there is Great-aunt Hortense—we
cannot leave her. You are to get up at once
when Proté calls you, take your petit déjeuner,
and then say good-by to maman. You are to shed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>38</a></span>
no tears. Now lie down and go to sleep. I will tuck
you up!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine lay down, shutting her eyes
obediently, though the tears forced themselves from
under her lashes.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle leaned over and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Always remember that you are a Saint Frère,
Marie Josephine,” he said.</p>

  <h2 id='ch04' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter IV</span> <br /> <br />JEAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“Jean!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Mother Barbette listened. It was the third time
she had called within five minutes. First it had been
“Petit Jean,” then “Jean,” and the third time there
was a note in her voice which meant, “If you know
what’s best for you, you’d better come at once. I
know you’re hiding somewhere. The branches of
the pear tree by the old well make good switches!”</p>

<p class='c018'>She waited, listening. There was no answer
except the sleepy twitter of meadow larks in the
field beyond. Mother Barbette shaded her eyes
from the hot noon sunshine and looked off across
the deep green of grass and trees. The grass had
been freshly cut and mounds of it lay about the
cottage dooryard. Its sweet, warm scent was everywhere.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are somewhere about, of that I’m sure, and
now I’m going to find out!” Mother Barbette’s
black eyes twinkled mischievously as she spoke.
“When I went up to the big house with the eggs I
heard such a piece of news!” she called out.</p>

<p class='c018'>A green mound moved suddenly in a jerking way,
and the next second a dark head and two bright
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'>40</a></span>
black eyes peered out. Then a brown hand appeared,
closing quickly and just missing an elusive
yellow butterfly. Then the whole of the boy came
into view. He was covered with grass from head
to foot. It stuck to his frayed, yellow trousers and
had crept down the collar of his black blouse. It
tickled his nose, and he blinked his eyes for it was
even wound into his eyelashes. He had swallowed
some of it, and when he saw his mother’s surprised
face, he began to laugh, and then to choke, and she
had to slap him on the shoulders before he could
stop. As soon as he could speak, he said eagerly:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell me at once, Petite Mère, tell me what you
heard.” He caught at her apron and pulled it.
“Was there news of Paris, of the young ladies and
Monsieur Lisle?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Maybe it was that!” Mother Barbette chuckled
as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are teasing me, Petite Mère. Tell me, is
the family coming?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean tugged at the blue apron. He was small
for his thirteen years, and had a quaint, babylike
face.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Some of them are coming!” His mother was
teasing now.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean frowned but he smiled almost at the same
time, so that a dimple showed in his thin cheek.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You know it is of Mademoiselle Marie Josephine
I would hear. Tell me, is she coming?” he
asked breathlessly.</p>
<div id='illus05' class='figcenter'>

<p class='c019'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>41</a></span>
His mother nodded, and he began to jump up and
down, up and down, until he could not jump any
more. Then he threw himself down upon the mound
of grass from which he had emerged and flung his
broad, torn straw hat up in the air, shouting as
loud as he could shout, which was very loud
indeed. His mother put both her hands over her
ears.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Hush, you are like a wild animal to-day. Little
Mademoiselle will not wish to speak with you if
you are rough. Come, I’ve no time to stand idle
here. There is so much to do, the apartments to
make ready. It is different indeed from the old
days, for only the governess and one maid, the little,
fat Proté, are to accompany the young ladies. None
of the other servants of the Paris household are to
come. There will only be the cook and scullery
servants, an upstairs maid or two, and two men
servants at Les Vignes—no state, no ceremony, no
gaiety of any kind. The messenger who brought
the news says that some of the Paris servants have
left, and others are going. He says that they are
storming the Tuileries palace—the people I mean,
thousands of them. Madame la Comtesse became
alarmed at the sound of battle and the cannonading,
and late last night she sent a rider here. He arrived
at mid-afternoon, and would only stay for
a glass of wine and a bite of bread. He said he
must make haste back again.” As Mother Barbette
talked, she went inside her cottage door and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>42</a></span>
Jean followed her, giving whoops of delight as he
did so. His mother looked at him gravely.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You need not make so much noise, my child.
It is because of bad times that the young demoiselles
are coming. We are so out of the way here in
Pigeon Valley, without so much as an inn or a shop.
Jacques, the rider, says we may be thankful that
we are away from the towns. We are better off,
he says, just to be here by ourselves in the valley,
but we are bad enough off, some of us!” Mother
Barbette sighed as she went over to her white wood
table which, having been freshly scrubbed, shone
in the late sunshine. “Jacques told many things
and I know he spoke the truth, but it is hard to
believe them.” She wrapped two loaves of bread,
which stood on the table, in a clean towel which
she took from a table drawer.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean was impressed by his mother’s tones, and
followed her over to the table.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What did he say, Petite Mère?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Many things which you must not hear, or you
will be having bad dreams as you did after eating
so much of the cherry tart that the kind Nannette
at the big house made for me on my birthday. Run
now with this bread to your cousins.” Mother
Barbette sighed as she handed the bundle to Jean,
who put out his under lip sulkily.</p>

<p class='c018'>“They had bread on Monday. Grigge is a horrid
boy. I do not like any of them,” he objected.
Nevertheless he took the bundle and started slowly
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>43</a></span>
toward the door. He knew that it would not do to
trifle with his mother that day, but there was nothing
he disliked more than a visit to his cousins, who
lived in a straggling settlement of poor hovels near
the entrance to Les Vignes.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Do not grumble or complain or you will have a
good taste of the pear-tree switch. Your cousins,
have nothing, and never have had anything. You
should not be selfish just because you have food
every day, and goat’s milk too. It is only because
of the kindness of the old Comte Saint Frère, who
left in his will the word that you and I were to
have our maintenance here in the cottage, that we
are not begging for our food in the town squares.
You know that well. It is not Madame la Comtesse
who cares where we are or what we do. Run now,
and take shame to yourself for your greediness!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Mother Barbette was very uneasy and this made
her tongue sharper than usual. She stood at the
door watching Jean. He was all she had in the
world, and when he looked at her with his merry,
naughty, black eyes she seemed to see the young
Jean Barbette who had wooed and married her, and
who had died some few years back defending the old
Comte Saint Frère from an attack by a stag when
on a hunt. The fine old comte had never starved
the peasants working for him, or laughed at their
misery. The young Comte Lisle, too, had something
gallant and lovable about him, in spite of the
proud way he held his head. Mother Barbette
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'>44</a></span>
sighed again, but soon she remembered that she
had no time to stand and dream, and immediately
began to busy herself about the cottage, humming
the while. After giving a stir to the soup in the
iron stock pot which hung over a low fire in her
wide, stone fireplace, she went out, not even closing
the cottage door after her. A loud caw greeted
her as she stood for a moment drinking in the
clear air. It was sunset time, and the sky showed
salmon pink through the waving greenness of the
trees. Mother Barbette turned and saw a black
crow sitting on the stone window ledge.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You need not caw to me, Pince Nez. You
need not say you are sorry because you stole my
thimble and tape last night and went off and hid
them somewhere. Pince Nez! What a silly name
even if Little Mademoiselle did give it to you!”
Madame Barbette smiled as she hurried down the
path and then, to her right, up the driveway to
the great house, which loomed grimly against the
sunset-tinted sky. The gamekeeper’s lodge was near
the house, and so it was only a walk of a few minutes.
There had not been another gamekeeper since
her Jean had been killed, for the old comte had
died and the young Comte Lisle was too young for
hunting. Louise Barbette, with her boy, lived on at
the lodge, making a scanty living for both of them
by sewing when she could get any to do, and by
weeding her tiny garden, which furnished all the
food they had, except for the poor flour which made
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>45</a></span>
the thin, dark loaves of bread which she had sent
by Jean to their poorer relatives.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean ran across the field and into the wood beyond.
Every now and then he would give a clear,
high call and then he would stop and listen. Once
there was an answering call and then he laughed
and his thin little face with its funny dimple wrinkled
with delight.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m happy and that’s why the lark answered.
They never do if I’m cross,” he thought, and began
to sing: “Tra la la, tra la la! They’ll be here the
day after to-morrow. I shall hide behind the poplar
trees by the gate and see them drive in!”</p>

<p class='c018'>The way was long through the wood, which was
part of the Saint Frère demesne, but it was beautiful
and the air was cool and fragrant. After a
while Jean began to run. It was fun to run in and
out of the sweet greenness, always following the
path which ended finally at a low stone paling. Jean
could see, not far off, the towering arch of the great
entrance way to the vast estate. He was never
allowed to go in and out that way. He climbed the
paling and ran across a field until he came to a dusty
highway. He shuffled along the road, enjoying the
thick clouds of dust that he raised about him. Little
Mademoiselle would be coming in two days! He
was on his way to his cousins—that was the only bit
of blackness on his horizon. His cousins lived in
one of a row of poor hovels situated some little way
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>46</a></span>
back from the roadside. Women sat in the rude
doorways, glad of a breath of the fresh air. They
were gaunt, sad-looking women, old long before their
time because of years of heavy work in the fields,
little food, and no rest at all. Children swarmed
about the doorways and in the rough-looking stubble
field beyond.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean stopped before the next to the last hut, where
a lanky boy in ragged clothes stood slouching against
the doorway. He had a long, ugly face and he was
so thin that he seemed nothing but bones and eyes.
He snatched one of the loaves of bread from under
Jean’s arm and began eating it, tearing at the end
of it with his teeth. The second loaf and the towel
fell to the ground as Jean caught the other end of
the loaf that Grigge was devouring and pulled at
it with all his might.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You shall not eat it all up. The others shall
have their share,” he cried. But Grigge, who, in
spite of his thinness, was stronger than Jean, being
two years his senior and used to rough work, pulled
himself away, bread and all, and went inside the
hut. Jean turned around only to find his two
younger cousins and the children next door fighting
for the second loaf. He knew that there was nothing
he could do to separate them or reason with
them and so, having brought the bread, he could
only leave them to fight it out. There were a dozen
children now fighting for the loaf. Jean watched
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>47</a></span>
them for a moment and then turned back toward
home. A voice called to him from the doorway
in mocking tones. It was Grigge. He spoke between
mouthfuls.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You think you are very fine because you live
with the gentry. You think you are a prince because
you live within the gates!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean turned and shook his fists at him and then
ran on. He was in no mood for a fight with his
cousin just then. Little rosy clouds floated in the
sky, the air was full of the scent of the warm earth
and cool wind. Jean began to run. He ran on
faster and faster. He liked to think that he was
flying. He was going home to a bowl of hot soup
and the comfort of his mother’s presence.</p>

<p class='c018'>As he ran through the wood, Jean began to feel
very sorry indeed for his cousins. His mother was
right. They had never had anything. He was
sorry that he had not wanted to take them the
bread. His mother’s cottage came into view as
he reached the clearing in the wood. Mother Barbette
was sitting on the doorstep knitting and the
white deal table was drawn close to the door.
When he came up to her he threw both arms around
her and gave her a hug.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am a good boy. I know I am, Petite Mère,
because the lark answered when I called. It never
does if I am naughty.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Your soup is keeping hot over the fire. Dish
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>48</a></span>
it out carefully into your own blue bowl. There
is a piece of bread on the table. You may eat it
with your soup here at the table by the door. The
night is so fine that I could not stay inside.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I would rather sit on the doorstep beside you,
Petite Mère,” Jean answered, bringing his porringer
of soup, and sitting down at his mother’s
feet.</p>

<p class='c018'>He did not talk at all until he had finished his
soup and bread, for he was very hungry. When
he was finished he went in and peered inside the
stock pot, but there was no more soup.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am still hungry, Petite Mère. I want more
bread,” he complained, coming to the door.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You cannot have any more bread to-day. You
have had enough. Perhaps when the Little Mademoiselle
comes she will give you a piece of white
bread and fig jam,” returned his mother.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean’s face brightened and he leaned against his
mother’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You will make the jam for the big house again
this year. Little Mademoiselle and I will watch
and taste and then take some bread and jam to
the woods for a picnic. We shall go to our favorite
spot near the sundial. I love it best of all, Petite
Mère. It is all dark and woodsy and then there
is suddenly the open clearing and the sundial!”
Jean began to hop about the low-ceilinged room,
from one end to the other. He would have liked to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'>49</a></span>
have jumped up on Mother Barbette’s treasure, her
four-poster bed, but he did not dare to do so.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are so young, Jean. Will you ever grow
up? Ah, I cannot credit what Jacques told us,
but it must be true. Those brave fellows from
Provence marched all the way to Paris! Jacques
left while they were storming the king’s palace!
What times! What days!” Mother Barbette
shook her head over her knitting. Then she remarked
to Jean, “Your cousins were thankful for
the bread, I’ll wager!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean nodded vigorously.</p>

<p class='c018'>“They were as hungry as Wolf, the lodgekeeper’s
dog, after he was lost for four days. They tore
the bread to bits and all the other children came.
They were fighting over one loaf when I came
away.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Mother Barbette dropped her knitting in her lap
and bowed her head.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Grigge was the worst of them all, Petite Mère.
He snatched a whole loaf for himself and he taunted
me again. Grigge is not my friend.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“He is always hungry, poor Grigge. He works
all day at the olive mill for so little a pittance; it is
no wonder that they starve.” Mother Barbette
sighed as she spoke and Jean patted her cheek.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are not to do that again, Petite Mère. You
should smile because Little Mademoiselle is coming!
I am going to find Dian and tell him the
good news!” Jean made a dash at Pince Nez who
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>50</a></span>
had alighted on the back of Mother Barbette’s
chair. Then he ran with a whoop down the little
box-bordered path, through a hedgelike opening into
the forest, on through piney sweetness, through deep,
dark arches of mingling boughs, on and on, until he
came to a great sweep of sloping meadows.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean saw the grey, moving mass of a flock of
sheep in the distance, and he did not stop running
until he had come up to them. Some one was walking
beside them, a tall man in a grey smock, his long,
red locks falling about his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Dian, Dian, they are coming to Les Vignes, the
Little Mademoiselle and the other young ladies!”
Jean cried.</p>

<p class='c018'>The shepherd smiled a slow, quiet smile.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, I know that they are coming. I saw Jacques
the runner. They are coming, but the young Comte
Lisle remains in Paris with his mother,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean skipped along beside the shepherd. They
were great friends and it was always easy for him
to talk to Dian.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I was very naughty to-day. I did not want to
take the bread to Grigge and the others. I do not
like Grigge. Why do you take your time to teach
him to read and write, Dian? He is not at all a
nice boy. He is like a wolf.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The shepherd had reached the sheepfold door,
and he stood with both hands against it, ready to
push it open. He paused at Jean’s words, uttering
no reproach, but looking off across the field to where
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>51</a></span>
a delicate mist mingled with the startling beauty
of the sunset sky. Jean stood watching him digging
his bare toes into the soft earth.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Grigge will learn,” was Dian’s answer as he
went inside the sheepfold.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>52</a></span>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter V</span> <br /> <br />INSIDE THE COACH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The coach was so heavy that as it rolled along
the quiet country road it made a noise like thunder.
The coach was gilded and on the panels were hand-painted
pictures of cupids dancing. There had always been
two men up on the high seat behind and two in
front. Now there was only one man who was
driving, and he was not really a coachman at all,
but Neville, a footman of the Saint Frères’. He
wore a dark livery and he was very intent on his
driving.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine leaned way out of the window
and looked at him. Then she sat back on the blue
velvet cushions of the coach so hard that she bounced
up and down.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Neville looks so funny, so solemn and frowning!”
She laughed as she spoke, but there was a
little catch in her voice. They had always been
taught to hide their feelings with a smile, and Marie
Josephine knew that her grandfather would have
been glad to hear her laugh. It had all been so
strange and different early yesterday morning.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_53' id='Page_53'>53</a></span>
Proté had brought her her chocolate and petit pain
and she had had her breakfast before she had been
dressed. When she had come down to the great
entrance hall her mother had been there, waiting.
Lisle was there, too, and Hortense and Denise and
Madame le Pont. The governess and the girls were
ready for departure in their mantles and traveling
hats. Maman had seemed different, though she
wore, as usual, the mourning for grandfather, the
diamond brooch that fastened her lace fichu, and
her hair powdered and dressed high, like the queen’s.
Maman had been different in spite of all these
familiar things. She had held Marie Josephine’s
hand as she had talked to the governess, giving directions
in her quick, commanding way.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is, of course, not the slightest danger to
the children. You will not have the least inconvenience,
except that you will not have proper
service, but I don’t trust the other men servants.
There may come a time later on when it will not
be so easy to get away. They may guard the gates
if things get worse. I am glad to see you starting
for Les Vignes.”</p>

<p class='c018'>While maman had been speaking the steady roar
of cannonading never stopped. It had followed
them a long way out of the city. They had even
heard its faint ghostly murmur when they were
lunching at an inn. Marie Josephine had not
remembered all that her mother had said, but she had
sensed suddenly that there was danger. She had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>54</a></span>
thought over again and again of her mother’s remark:
“There may come a time later on when it
will not be so easy to get away. They may guard
the gates if things get worse.” Maman had, as always,
thought of her as being young and unheeding,
but she had been listening closely. The others had
been talking amongst themselves and had not heard.
Over and over the words came back to her: “There
may come a time later on when it will not be so easy
to get away.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Cécile du Monde was the only one who smiled
when Marie Josephine spoke of Neville. She sat
between Hortense and Denise, opposite Marie
Josephine and the governess. It had been decided
at the last moment that she was to come. She and
her brother were distant connections of the De
Soignés’ and the Marquis de Soigné had charge of
their estates, which were far away in the southwest
of France. They were orphans and spent most of
their time with their Paris relatives. Madame de
Soigné had refused to allow her own child to leave
her at the hurried conference in the middle of the
night, after the bal masqué was hastily broken up.
The sound of cannonading was heard, and alarming
reports came in from all sides. It was like the
Comtesse Saint Frère to act quickly. She had decided
at once that the children, with the exception
of Lisle, who refused to leave her, were to start at
once for Pigeon Valley and had offered its hospitality
to her friends. Madame de Soigné had accepted
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>55</a></span>
first for Bertran, who was a troublesome,
spoiled boy, of whom she was glad to be rid in the
midst of such an anxious time. Then after a talk
with Cécile, who felt that she should go with her
brother who was younger than she, it had been arranged
that they should both accompany the Saint
Frère children. As Lisle had told Marie Josephine
it would be, Bertran rode with his servant. The
sound of their horses’ hoofs could be heard faintly
in the still midday air.</p>

<p class='c018'>Proté sat on a stool at Marie Josephine’s feet
although there was plenty of room for her in the
seats of the great, roomy coach. Ever since Marie
Josephine could remember Proté had sat on the
stool at her feet and held her treasures for her
as she grew tired of them. Once it had been a large,
gilded, blue glass vase, another time a miniature
of her great-grandfather, and once a red silk shawl
which she had held in her arms pretending it was
a baby, cooing to it and singing to it. But all that
had been, of course, when she was very young. The
wooden Austrian doll, called Trudle, which her
uncle had brought her from his journeyings, had always
accompanied her until this summer. Madame
de Pont, even in the midst of her worry, noticed
Trudle’s absence and said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Where, chérie, is the little friend Trudle?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are like the others, Madame. You think
of me always as a baby, just a baby. Dolls, dolls—why
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>56</a></span>
I am done with them!” This time they all
laughed, even Proté, who would not have dared
to do so had they been accompanied by Madame
Saint Frère! She knew well that Trudle was safe
in the packing box, on top of the coach!</p>

<p class='c018'>Flambeau rested his nose on the ledge of the coach
window and looked out yearningly at a fragrant
stretch of green meadow. His eyes followed the
sudden flight of birds from the branch of a great
poplar as they thundered by it.</p>

<p class='c018'>At lunch time a very small inn seemed to grow
suddenly out of the ground as they turned a bend in
the road. It was painted green and seemed a part
of the rich August countryside. Neville stopped the
horses, climbed down from the box, and bowing, held
his hat in his hand, as he spoke to Madame le Pont:</p>

<p class='c018'>“If it is your pleasure, Madame, I think you and
the young ladies can find refreshment here. There
is a sign which says that meals are served.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Madame and the girls looked out and exclaimed
in astonishment:</p>

<p class='c018'>“The old mill!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Neville had opened the coach door while he was
speaking and Flambeau and Marie Josephine
jumped out. The others followed after a moment,
and they all stood in a group looking across at the
odd-shaped, mill-like structure that stood a little
way back from the road, with its sign, “Food for
Travelers,” swaying in the light summer breeze.
A year ago it had been just an old mill, grey and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'>57</a></span>
gaunt in the midst of its green setting of great
oaks. The governess turned to Neville uncertainly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are sure that it is wise to come here? It
seems odd finding the old mill so unexpectedly!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Let us stay for déjeuner. Oh, it’s a dear place,
as quaint as can be!” put in Denise, and Neville
answered:</p>

<p class='c018'>“I think it is wiser than to go to a village inn. I
am taking the long route to avoid the villages. That
was the order of Madame la Comtesse. There is
no real danger, of course, in the villages, but just
now Madame felt justly that one cannot be over
careful.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Madame le Pont nodded in assent. “We will
remain here for déjeuner, Neville.”</p>

<p class='c018'>A tall, dark young woman served them with good
soup, an excellent omelette, and some grapes, at a
table covered with a clean, white cloth, on the
greensward facing the forest. She stayed by while
they ate, asking with a curtsy every now and then,
if there was anything more that they wished, or
anything special that she could procure for them.
She was particularly kind to Flambeau, cutting his
meat nicely and putting it in a blue saucer by the
lunch table. Marie Josephine was so pleased at
this that she went up to the woman after they had
finished lunch and said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Flambeau wants to thank you for his déjeuner.
He is very tired of the journey and will be glad
when we are home at Les Vignes.”</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>58</a></span>
The young woman, who had said her name was
Paulette, smiled kindly and seemed interested.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Pigeon Valley is indeed beautiful, Little Mademoiselle.
The other young ladies, are they your
sisters?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“A sister and a cousin and a friend.” Marie
Josephine smiled happily at the dark woman who
was patting Flambeau’s head.</p>

<p class='c018'>Just at that moment Bertran du Monde came
galloping up to the queer mill-inn, with his servant
riding behind him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The young gentleman would be your brother I
suppose, little lady?” the woman asked as she
turned toward the inn.</p>

<p class='c018'>“That boy is not my brother. My brother is in
Paris with maman,” Marie Josephine answered a
little indignantly, but the woman was walking away
and did not seem to have heard her. Marie Josephine
was not used to speaking to strangers, but
the dark young woman had been very kind to
Flambeau.</p>

<p class='c018'>Bertran was very hungry and he was cross because
he had to wait for his omelette. He was a
very fat boy indeed, but he rode well and was not
in the least tired. When Madame le Pont suggested
his coming into the coach for a while and
letting his servant lead his horse, he said, “Ride in
the stuffy coach and hear the girls chattering! No,
I will not, Madame!”</p>

<p class='c018'>They left him sitting at the table, waited on by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>59</a></span>
his servant. A stone in his horse’s shoe had been
the cause of their arriving after the others. It was
thought best for the coach to start on as it could
not make such good time, and so they waved their
hands at Bertran and rumbled on toward the forest.
Two people in the coach did not wave. They were
Madame le Pont and Marie Josephine. The latter
was more than ever out of sorts with Bertran. It
had come over her suddenly that it was indeed
Bertran and not Lisle who was with them. So,
when he had answered Madame about the coach, she
had said to him, “It is not you we want in the coach,
Bertran. It is some one else.” He had answered,
sitting down at his déjeuner as he spoke:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Is that so, Mademoiselle Spitfire! Well, I shall
do as I like. When I wish to ride inside I shall do
so, and when I don’t, I won’t!” Then he had gone
on calmly with his omelette.</p>

<p class='c018'>They thundered into the forest and its spicy fragrance
greeted them. The air was cool there, and the
dim wood paths seemed like fairy paths to Marie
Josephine. It was so peaceful that it made them
all think of Pigeon Valley. They grew more cheerful
right away, and even Madame le Pont remarked
that it was delightful to think of seeing Les Vignes
again. She had purchased some fruit at the inn and
Denise held a bunch of amber-colored grapes high
above Cécile’s head and said, “Bite one!” Madame
le Pont remarked, “That is not the way a young
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>60</a></span>
lady conducts herself!” but she did not seem to be
really shocked at all.</p>

<p class='c018'>Hortense yawned and put her head back on the
cushions, her curls falling about her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You look like a little girl to-day, Hortense. I
thought you looked such a very grand young lady
when you danced the minuet with Lisle the night
before last.” They were still driving through the
woods and every now and then a startled bird would
make a great stir in the trees or underbrush as
they dashed along. Marie Josephine did not realize
what she had said at first, but when they all turned
and looked at her and Denise exclaimed: “When
you saw her dancing with Lisle! What do you
mean, Marie Josephine? You were not at the ball!”
she knew how stupid she had been and the telltale
color flew to her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c018'>“How could you have seen me dance at the ball
when you were fast asleep in bed?” put in Hortense.</p>

<p class='c018'>Cécile looked straight at Marie Josephine and
suddenly she guessed. She knew that Rosanne had
been hiding in the balcony. There was a twinkle in
her blue eyes as she looked at Marie Josephine, but
she would not have told her suspicions for anything
in the world.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are blushing. You have done something
very naughty. I am sure of it!” Denise said
this with a relish. She was tired, and she had always
had a habit of keeping persistently at a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>61</a></span>
subject. She and Marie Josephine did not get on
very well.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell me what you meant when you said that
about Hortense dancing at the ball, Marie
Josephine,” she persisted.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine’s eyes began to twinkle, too.
She settled back comfortably against the pillows and
called Flambeau’s attention to some black baby pigs
which a woman in a scarlet petticoat was feeding
at a moss-covered wooden trough. Denise kept her
eyes on Marie Josephine, who held Flambeau’s paws
as the dog looked interestedly at the pigs. Marie
Josephine knew that Proté, who still sat on the little
stool at her feet, was shaking in her shoes. It would
be fun to tell in spite of the consequences, if it were
not for Proté and for Rosanne!</p>

<p class='c018'>“You dare not look me in the eyes and say that
you did not go to the ball,” persisted Denise, who
was becoming more and more interested and excited.
She had not at first really believed that her sister
had gone to the ball and had kept on the subject
because she felt in a teasing mood, but Marie Josephine’s
telltale color betrayed her and Proté’s look
of horror confirmed her suspicions.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Proté helped you, I know she did. Tell me,
Proté, did you not aid Mademoiselle to go to the
De Soignés’ to see the ball?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Denise, to do her justice, would not have kept
up with the subject had their mother, the comtesse,
been with them, but none of them were very much
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'>62</a></span>
in awe of Madame le Pont. There was no need
for Marie Josephine to reply for Proté clasped her
hands and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Heaven be with us! I meant no harm. It
was so wrong for Little Mademoiselle to have none
of the pleasure!”</p>

<p class='c018'>All eyes were turned toward Madame le Pont
who, to their unbounded surprise, did not seem in
any way as horrified as they had expected! She
looked at Marie Josephine and then at the others
and said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“After all, now that so many things are happening,
what does it matter!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Could it be true! Their governess saying, “What
does it matter!” Madame le Pont, who, in spite
of her being more indulgent than the governesses
of their friends, had always been so fond of the
conventions! She did not even seem to realize what
Marie Josephine had done, and she said nothing at
all to Proté, who sat looking the picture of fright
and despair! Denise was so surprised at the attitude
of the governess that she whispered to Cécile
under cover of the rumbling of the coach:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Le Pont is in a dream, surely, but I am glad.
I was excited and didn’t realize what a scrape
they would be in!”</p>

Years later Marie Josephine remembered the
incident; in fact she never really forgot it. There
were times when she could shut her eyes and see,
in that uncanny way in which we do see long-ago
things, the old coach, the faded coat of arms that
had not been regilded that summer, the old blue
lining, the warm August sun streaming in, bringing
with it the odor of freshly cut hay and oats, thin
rows of poplars rising against the startling blue of
the sky, and the peasant women bending over their
work in the field beyond. She could see Denise’s
astonished gaze, from under her lace hood. She always
remembered the words and the whole incident
because it was the beginning of the great change.
Madame le Pont was right. Things that had mattered
so much were beginning to be not so important.
There would be a time when they would
not matter at all.</p>

  <h2 id='ch06' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter VI</span> <br /> <br />AUGUST TENTH, 1792</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Lisle and his mother had finished their déjeuner
in the great dining room of the Paris house. The
tall, gilded clock in the entrance hall had just struck
twelve. All through the meal the cannons in the
Carrousel, the inner court of the Tuileries palace,
less than a mile away, had thundered outside. The
glass chandelier above the table had shaken until its
chains, jangling together, made a sound like music
in the dim, vast room. The amber-colored velvet
curtains at the windows were drawn closely together
and the room was lighted by four candles in gold
candlesticks on the table.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle piled his nutshells in a heap on his plate. He
had something to tell his mother and he did not
know how to go about it. There was a dish of fruit
on the table, as well as a carved bowl full of nuts
and a carafe of wine and one of water, and even a
bowl of flowers, a few red roses which Henri had
picked that morning from the vine by the coach
house. The comtesse leaned forward and picked
one from the white bowl and held it to her face.
Then she said what she had been thinking all through
the meal:</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>65</a></span>
“Nothing would matter if only you had gone with
the others, Lisle. Why did I let you stay!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Because you knew that I would not go!” Lisle
answered.</p>

<p class='c018'>She looked at him and he returned her look
steadily.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m not a child any longer. I’m fifteen and a
half and the head of the house,” he went on. “I’ve
stayed to see Paris now. I want to see what
happens.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The comtesse put both hands over her eyes and
sat that way for a moment. It was as though she
would shut out all the confusion and worry of the
past weeks and months, especially of the last two
days.</p>

<p class='c018'>Within twenty-four hours five of the men servants
had left without a word. Some of them left because
they were frightened, for it was beginning to be
thought not so good a thing to be a servant in a great
house. It was not the loss of her servants that mattered
so much. It was the fact that they were her
enemies, and that, with the exception of those who
had gone to Pigeon Valley, there was only one remaining
whom she could trust—and that was Henri,
one of the footmen.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Pardon, Madame, you asked for fresh news from
the Tuileries. It is going hard with the Swiss guards.
They made a brave stand but they are losing badly,
Madame. They cannot resist the people, above all
the Marseillais!”</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>66</a></span>
It was Henri who spoke. They had not heard
him cross the great room.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The Marseillais are fighting well?” It was
Lisle who put the question.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Like tigers, Monsieur Lisle,” the servant answered.
He was a little, dark man. His voice
shook as he spoke and his face was white above his
red and gold livery.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The royal family—they are safe?” Madame
Saint Frère twisted her lace-bordered handkerchief
between her long, white hands as she asked the
question, but her voice did not tremble.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Henri cannot know what is going on inside the
palace or the Carrousel, maman. He can only glean
wild rumors from the crowds in the side streets,”
Lisle said a little contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Pardon, Monsieur Lisle, but a runner came
through and shouted news at the Town Hall. The
royal family have taken refuge in the riding school
with the National Assembly. They went through
the gardens.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Henri waited, and, as the two did not question
him again, he left the room as quietly as he had
entered it.</p>

<p class='c018'>The comtesse reread a note that lay beside her
plate. It was from Monsieur Laurent, Lisle’s tutor,
and it stated in polite terms that he had left that
morning for England, having had a sudden opportunity
to get away. His departure seemed unbearable
to the comtesse. Now that Laurent had gone,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'>67</a></span>
there were no other men that she could count on at
all. She had a brother who was an invalid and some
cousins who were preparing to fight with the
Royalists but they were not in Paris at the moment.
The Comte de Soigné was away fighting. It seemed
as though every kind of protection had left her.
Things were happening so suddenly, one after another,
and although one could not believe that there
could be any real danger for any of her family,
she would have given much, as she said, to have had
her only son safe at Pigeon Valley.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Promise me, Lisle, that you will not go out into
the garden,” she said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I cannot promise that, maman. I’ll not be
cooped up in the house. You are fretting about
that stupid Laurent. I for one am glad he is gone.
I never want to see his smirking face again.” Lisle
leaned forward and spoke earnestly. “You must
trust yourself to me, maman. I told you the girls
should be sent at once to the country, and you see
that I was right. Whatever happens at the Tuileries,
it is only a question of time until the Austrian
army comes and our own royalist armies are ready.”
Lisle looked so earnestly at his mother and spoke so
confidently that the comtesse smiled in spite of herself
and returned his look with one of pride.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Maman, I don’t trust Henri,” Lisle continued,
speaking softly. “He does not really mean us harm,
I think, but he is from Provence and the Marseillais
are from Provence. They are proving themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>68</a></span>
to be brave soldiers. Henri, once he is in the crowd,
will be heart and soul with them. You will see!”</p>

<p class='c018'>As Lisle spoke the tapestry at the far door
swayed back and Henri came into the room.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Madame la Comtesse de Soigné is here to see
Madame,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle walked with his mother to the salon door,
but did not go inside. As Henri opened the door,
Lisle saw his mother’s friend cross the room and
come toward her. Rosanne stood near the door
and made a curtsy as his mother entered. Lisle
waited until Henri had left the hall and then went
through the marble vestibule, opened the great,
grilled door, which was the front entrance, and went
outside. Gonfleur was waiting by the door. Lisle
went up to the old man.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Gonfleur,” he said to him, “you are the only one
I can trust. There is not one of our servants who
is true to us, now that Neville has gone.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Gonfleur bowed and answered: “I am only an
old man, Monsieur Lisle, but there is nothing I
would not do for the family. Madame de Soigné
knows that well. She is in trouble, is Madame la
Comtesse.” He did not say more, so Lisle turned
away and went inside to the great drawing-room.
His mother and Madame de Soigné were sitting on
a velvet chaise longue at one end of the room and
talking earnestly. Long mirrors reached to the
ceiling on each side of the room. The rose carpet
was of velvet and sank under Lisle’s feet as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>69</a></span>
crossed over to his mother. There were gilded
tables and chairs and carved cabinets filled with jeweled
trinkets. The hangings at the long windows
were of rose brocade.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle came up to the chaise longue and bowed ceremoniously
to the comtesse and to Rosanne, who
stood close to her mother. Madame de Soigné was
to leave Paris at once, they told him. She had just
had word that her husband, who was with the Royalists,
had been wounded and she could not stay away
from him another hour. Gonfleur would accompany
her and Madame Saint Frère was to keep Rosanne
safe with her. The Comte de Soigné was in a hospital
near Valmy.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It would have been well, Madame, had you
allowed Rosanne to accompany my sisters and the
others to Les Vignes.” Lisle spoke coldly; but when
the comtesse answered, with tears in her eyes, that
she had not dreamed of all that twenty-four hours
would bring forth, he said simply, “I will care for
Rosanne as though she were my little sister.” Then
he went out of the room.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was no one in the great hall, and going into
an anteroom he took down his black velvet cape and
cap and went out through the great entrance door,
closing it after him. He ran quickly down the marble
steps, and, after standing a moment uncertainly
on the corner, turned to the right and walked toward
the Champs Élysées.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a strange walk, the first one he had ever
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>70</a></span>
taken alone in the city. He had always been accompanied
by his tutor or a servant. Boys of noble birth
did not go out unattended. It was the strangest day
that he had ever known. A wild exhileration seized
him and he began to run. He had felt this way before
when he had ridden to the hounds, when he had
run at top speed across the fields at Les Vignes, but
to-day it was as though he had never really known
emotion. The thunder of the cannonading at the
Tuileries pounded through the great avenue. As he
came nearer a black sea of people loomed before
him. The deafening roar of the guns, the screams
of the wounded, the wild shouting from thousands
of throats mingled, making a hurricane of sound.
He stopped suddenly, a little bewildered, and seeing
there would be no chance of going farther on the
avenue he turned off and round down a side street,
slackening his steps as he came to the rue Royale.</p>

<p class='c018'>Here the noise was greater, but although the
street was filled with people, some leaning out of
the windows of shops, others shouting from the roof
tops, he was able to make his way for some rods.
No one noticed him. He was only a drop in a
mighty ocean, only one among millions that tenth
day of August, 1792!</p>

<p class='c018'>There was a noisy crowd of excited onlookers on
top of a coach just beside him and the owner of
the coach, a prosperous spinner, who had drunk
deeply of Rhenish wine, was the noisiest of them
all. He caught sight of Lisle, who was wedged in
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>71</a></span>
between a group of taller people, and cried out to
him:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Come up and see the show, my fine fellow!”</p>

<p class='c018'>It was the first time that any one in all the wild
city had spoken to him. He jumped up on to the
coach and stood there with the spinner and his
family. The next instant he forgot everything but
the sight before his eyes.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was a group of people close to the cart.
One could hear their rough voices and harsh cries
above the seething roar of the battle in the great
square beyond. Their scarlet caps gleamed in the
relentless August sunshine. They held on to the
sides of the cart, screaming, “Vive la nation!” and
throwing their arms about each other in a sort of
frenzy. It was such as they who were to make a
part of the mob that was soon to govern Paris.</p>

<p class='c018'>Far at the end of the Place du Carrousel grenadiers,
pikemen, and gendarmes lay dead and dying.
Floating mists of smoke drifted with the sudden,
freakish changing of the wind, and through it all
the battle cry of “Death or Liberty” floated back
to the watching thousands in the Champs Élysées
gardens and in the surrounding streets.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The Marseillais have the Cour Royale!” was
the word passed from lip to lip, and then the cry of
“Vive la Nation” swelled like the storm tide of a sea.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The Swiss have given way! The Swiss can no
longer stand!”</p>

<p class='c018'>This last cry roused Lisle as he stood on the spinner’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'>72</a></span>
cart, and the meaning of it caught his heart.
The gallant Swiss guard who had fought, like the
brave fellows that they were, to guard the palace
and the royal family—the Swiss were vanquished!</p>

<p class='c018'>“The men of the Faubourg de Gloire have the
Cour des Princes! Hurrah for the Faubourg de
Gloire!” Again a mighty roar shook the very roofs
of the houses.</p>

<p class='c018'>Another court of the palace had fallen!</p>

<p class='c018'>The sun caught the bronze of the cannons in the
square and they flashed like scarlet fire through the
iron-grey smoke clouds.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The men of the Faubourg Saint-Marceau have
taken over the Cour des Suisses!”</p>

<p class='c018'>The last court of the Tuileries was in the hands
of the people.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle stood still in the sunshine watching the end
of all that had made up his life. He was too young
and inexperienced to realize very much beyond the
things that he had always known, quiet cherishing
of old traditions handed down, riches, beauty, unthinking
narrowness. His king and queen were in
hiding in the back confines of the Tuileries. The
great palace itself was given over to the people who
had taken it with bayonet and gun. The roar of
the cannons and of the thousands of voices meant a
good-by to the old ways. Lisle stood there like a
statue, his hands clenched at his sides, tears stinging
his eyelids, his gold hair ablaze in the sun. Then,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>73</a></span>
suddenly, almost without knowing it, he raised his
voice and cried with all his might:</p>

<p class='c018'>“God save King Louis!”</p>

<p class='c018'>He had hardly cried the last word before he was
seized from the cart and half dragged, half carried
at a swift pace down a side street off the rue Royale,
opposite which the cart had been standing. His
captor turned a corner swiftly, and then another,
and puffing and gasping for breath, he finally pushed
Lisle under a gabled doorway where they could not
be seen from the street. Lisle’s blue eyes flashed
fire into quiet brown ones. His captor was a short,
fat man in a snuff-colored cloak and wide hat. He
had a round, kindly face and, in spite of the situation,
he was smiling.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Take your hand off me. You are not to touch
me!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle was so angry that he spoke with difficulty
and his companion was so blown that he could only
puff and pant. He looked furtively around the
arched doorway of the deserted shop.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I was quick and no one shall say tha’ Humphrey
Trail canna run when the devil is close,” he said,
as though to himself. Still holding Lisle firmly by
the arm, he turned and smiled at him again, in no
way disturbed by the boy’s haughty face and flashing
eyes.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Not so fast, my young gentleman, not so fast.”
As he spoke Humphrey Trail pushed Lisle back a
little farther into the shadow. His hold was gentle
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>74</a></span>
but firm. “Tha hast a rare bright face. I’d not
thought tha’d sell tha life so easy there on the cart.
Hast tha no sense that tha calls 'Long live the king’
with them beside tha that would cut tha throat?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle tugged at Humphrey’s arm with both hands.
He was still so angry that he could scarcely speak.
After a moment he called out again, “God save King
Louis,” and smiled mockingly at Humphrey Trail.</p>

<p class='c018'>His captor seemed in no way put out by the cry,
for the side street was deserted and there was no
one to see or hear them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tha would do well to stop tha foolishness and
listen to sense. Tha cannot help tha king by tha
shouting. Hark to me, lad, and ponder well what
I say. This is the greatest day that France has ever
known. Mark me, lad, this is a day of brave deeds
and clean fighting. Days will come so black that
the country will never lose its shame o’ them; but
to-day the Marseillais have fought for the love o’
nation, and they have fought well.” Humphrey
still held Lisle as he spoke but loosened his grasp
when Lisle said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is no need to hold me, for I shall not run
away from you. There is no harm in you, except
that you are meddlesome. You say the Marseillais
fought bravely. Well, the Swiss guards fought
better! Even our servant, Henri, who is from Provence,
spoke of their bravery!” There was a choke
in Lisle’s voice, though he tried to swallow it. It
did not escape Humphrey Trail.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>75</a></span>
“Not so fast again, young lad. I but meddled,
as tha calls it, to save tha life!” he said, and, meeting
Lisle’s flashing eyes with his kindly ones, he smiled.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle held out his hand. “I believe you, Humphrey
Trail, and I thank you. Know that I am
grateful.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey shook Lisle’s hand warmly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Th’art no fool that tha remembered my name
from my sayin’ it that once. Tha speaks English
as well and maybe better than I who was born on
a Yorkshire moor,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle looked at him curiously. “You come from
England—from Yorkshire! Why are you here?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’d many a bit o’ gold coin saved from my
shearin’ and sheep sellin’. I wanted to see things
about the world, to go to foreign parts where there
wasn’t just milkin’ and farmin’. I wanted to see a
bit o’ life, and I am seein’ it and likely to see more.”
Humphrey laughed as he spoke and Lisle laughed,
too. All anger toward his rescuer had gone,
although he still resented being thought stupid for
having shouted for the king, and being carried off
by this funny, fat farmer in such an unceremonious
way.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey Trail caught hold of his arm and said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Haste tha home, young lad. Keep within tha
doors for a spell o’ days till things settle a bit. If
it please tha, I’ll see tha to tha door!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Thank you, Humphrey Trail, I have no fear of
being on the streets. I can go my way quite well
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>76</a></span>
alone. I cannot promise you to stay within doors
but, though I shall always shout for my king, I will
not forget your advice entirely.” Lisle held out his
hand and the farmer shook it again warmly, saying:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Good-by to thee, lad.”</p>

<p class='c018'>He watched Lisle as he walked on down the
narrow street and he muttered to himself, “Th’ lad,
th’ proud, odd lad!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Toward the end of the narrow lanelike street
Lisle paused, hesitated, turned back a step or two,
paused again, and then went straight on without
looking back. Humphrey noticed the action. The
boy had something he wanted to say to him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Th’ lad would ask a favor o’ me but his pride
put it by him. He wants a friend and there maybe
is no one else.” As this thought came to him, Humphrey
Trail threw the cape of his coat about his
shoulder and walked rapidly in the direction Lisle
had taken. He never lost sight of him. Lisle walked
straight ahead and did not once look back. He had
lost his velvet cap in the affair of the cart and he
walked on hatless, unafraid, his hair, a sweep of
blazing gold, tied at the back of his neck with a
flaring black bow. Humphrey’s heart almost failed
him as he watched Lisle. It was well indeed for
the boy that this tenth of August was not a day for
any one person. It was a day of great issues and
the time had not yet come for individuals! It was
a day of wild excitement, of gallantry and courage!
Humphrey Trail had spoken rightly when he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'>77</a></span>
said that it would be the bravest and the best day
of all. Those who guarded the Royal family in the
Tuileries had fought like the chivalrous knights that
they were. There were never more valorous soldiers
than the red-coated Swiss guards who held their
places for the king until they could no longer stand.
On the other side, there were never cleaner, braver
men than those gay, unfearing men of the Marseillais
battalion, who had marched for weeks, through
every kind of weather, to fight for liberty in Paris,
and who died singing their beloved Marseillaise
with their last breath,</p>

<p class='c018'>“L’amour sacrée de la patrie!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle reached his home in safety and, turning in
at the iron gates, ran up the marble steps and pulled
a silk rope at the side of the grilled iron door. He
heard the bell clang through the great house. The
door was opened at once by Henri, who gazed at
him with a white face and gasped out:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Monsieur Lisle, Madame, your mother, is beside
herself in fear for you!”</p>

<p class='c018'>When Humphrey saw the great doors close after
Lisle he turned and walked rapidly away. He knew
where the lad lived and he would not forget the
house.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle was met at the door of the first salon by
his mother, who caught him by both shoulders, raising
a pale, frightened face to his.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You have been out alone in all this rabble, you
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>78</a></span>
who are only a child.” She caught her breath with
a sob as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I have been out, but I am not a child, maman,
and I have made a friend all by myself, without any
help from the family.” Lisle smiled at his mother.
“I have made a friend in Paris to-day, and his name
is such an odd one, maman. It is Humphrey
Trail!”</p>

  <h2 id='ch07' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter VII</span> <br /> <br />AT LES VIGNES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“Mother Barbette is making fig jam and Nannette
has given me some croissants. Jean and I will
take a little bowl of the jam with us and we will
have a picnic in the woods!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine announced this from the foot
of the wide granite steps leading to the terrace at
Les Vignes. Hortense sat under a wide-spreading
oak tree at the right of the steps. She was doing a
piece of tapestry for a fire screen, weaving the glowing
colors, crimson, orange, and blue, in and out,
and every now and then holding her work in front
of her, surveying it critically.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are such a baby, Marie Josephine, thinking
always of silly plays with that infant, Jean. Why
do you not bring your embroidery and sit here with
Cécile and me under the tree. You promised maman
that you would finish the shawl of Great-aunt Hortense
so that she could have it when the cold days
come. Her house at Saint Germain is so chilly!”
Hortense shook out her silks as she spoke, holding
them so that the sunlight flickered through them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Bother Great-aunt Hortense! She always fusses
and frets about something and maman is so in awe
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>80</a></span>
of her. We treat her as though she were the queen.
I hate sewing when the sun shines like this. I don’t
like it any time. I tried to embroider one rainy day
when Jean and I listened to one of Dian’s stories in
Mother Barbette’s cottage but I could only think of
the story!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Cécile du Monde, who came walking slowly along
a garden path, laughed at Marie Josephine’s last
words, but Hortense frowned.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are too old to be so silly. You’ll be thirteen
in November. We may have to stay here at Les
Vignes for a year or even longer before we can go
back to Paris. I should think you would want to
begin to learn to be a young lady, Marie Josephine!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Name of a name, Hortense, do not preach so
much!” Marie Josephine returned crossly, but
smiled the next moment at her cousin’s horrified
expression.</p>

<p class='c018'>“That is dreadful. You are talking like a peasant.
It is because you go so much to Mother Barbette’s
cottage. She is a good woman but it will not do for
you to pick up expressions of the people!” Hortense
frowned again and turning to Cécile, who
came and stood at the back of her chair, she said
to her: “I wish that Le Pont had some authority
over Marie Josephine. She has none at all!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Bother!” put in Marie Josephine. “Come,
Flambeau!” she called as the dog bounded toward
her up the terrace steps. She patted his head while
she looked across at her cousin.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>81</a></span>
“You are not really a prig, Hortense, but you do
sound like one sometimes. None of us are as nice
as Mother Barbette and we never can be—none of
us, except Lisle,” she said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Cécile held a great sheaf of white and gold lilies
in her arms. Their sweetness blew about the girls
in the gentle wind. It was hot, with a hazy, sleepy
heat of mid-September. It was a little over a month
since they had come to Les Vignes.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Don’t squabble, girls. See these beauties. I am
going to give some to old Martin for the supper
table to-night. It is so warm we could almost have
supper out of doors,” Cécile said, sitting down on
a low chair beside Hortense.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Why do you say almost, Cécile! Of course, we
shall have supper outside to-night, of course we
shall! There comes Le Pont now. I’m going to
run and ask her. She must say 'Yes,’ for it will be
a wonderful evening!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine called this over her shoulder as
she ran to meet the governess who was coming
toward them down the terrace steps. She caught
Madame le Pont’s hands in both of hers and swung
them back and forth, and the kindly, worried face
of the little woman brightened.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is the most beautiful day in all the world,
Le Pont. It is a fairy day. Jean says that the birds
and flowers talk to him right here in the Les Vignes
woods when it is like this!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are happy. That is well, little one. Yes, it
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'>82</a></span>
is like the long ago days at Fontainebleau that I
remember so well. We used to hunt in the forest.”
Madame le Pont sighed as she spoke and, taking
Marie Josephine’s hand, walked with her toward the
others.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Cheer up, Le Pont dear, and do say that we may
have supper on the terrace, for we have set our
hearts on it, all of us, even old lady Hortense!”
coaxed Marie Josephine as Hortense and Cécile rose
to give the governess a chair.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Sit here please, Madame. I will walk a little
way with Marie Josephine, who is going to Madame
Barbette’s cottage,” said Cécile, putting her arm
about Marie Josephine and holding the lilies across
her shoulder with her other hand. “Wait for me
one moment while I give these lilies to Martin,
chérie. May I tell him, Madame, that we may have
supper on the terrace?” Cécile turned toward
Madame le Pont as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>The governess nodded, smiling a little sadly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, of course, if it pleases you, children, and
if the night air is not too chill,” she answered as she
sat down in Cécile’s chair beside Hortense, her satin
bag of work in her hand.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell Martin to put on the candelabra with the
gold shade!” Marie Josephine called after Cécile
as she went up the terrace steps, and her friend
looked back over her shoulder, smiling assent.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>83</a></span>
A few minutes later the two girls were walking
through the forest in the demesne at Les Vignes,
their arms about each other. They wore long, full
summer dresses of fine, sprigged Indian muslin,
which blew about them in the soft breeze. Cécile
had on a garden hat, which she had tied under her
chin with a pink bow, but Marie Josephine swung
her hat back and forth by its black velvet streamers.
She would not have gone so far as to carry one if
she had not known that Hortense and the governess
would have been shocked at her going about without
a hat.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I think that Neville will come to-night, Marie
Josephine, perhaps by sundown. Think of it, news
of them all, news of Lisle!” Cécile bowed her head
suddenly, almost as though she were praying.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We will be so glad to see Neville that we will
not know what to do. If I see him coming down
the drive, I shall run and run until I come up to him.
He will have messages from maman and Lisle and
Rosanne. Perhaps he will bring word that they are
on the way to us!” Marie Josephine put out her
hand to pat Flambeau, who was walking beside them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is a fortnight since he went. He should have
returned before this. It is not more than a good
two days’ ride with a fast horse and Neville rides
well. I hope so much that he comes to-night, Marie
Josephine. Chérie, we left in the midst of so much
and we have heard nothing since. I wish that we
were not so far away from everything,” Cécile
answered.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are worrying, Cécile, and you are not to do
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>84</a></span>
that. Try and be like Bertran and Denise, who
ride and dance and never seem to give a thought to
Paris. We are better off than if we were near a
town. Jacques, the runner, told Mother Barbette
so. He said we were well out of all the jamboree,
but—oh, I know what you mean, chérie; we want
news of Lisle!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Cécile stopped in the middle of the pathway and
kissed Marie Josephine on each cheek.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll go back now and sit with the others under
the oak tree. Sometimes I am envious of little Jean
because he has you for a comrade more than I.”
Cécile was smiling as she spoke, but Marie Josephine
felt that she was in earnest.</p>

<p class='c018'>“If only you would come with us sometimes to
the woods. We know of so many pretty places and
we have such jolly times,” she said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Cécile turned and waved as she started back down
the forest path and Marie Josephine, after waving
in return, ran on through the dark archways of the
trees. When she came to a clearing in the wood she
saw Mother Barbette’s little red cottage with the
smoke rising in zigzag fashion from its chimney.
She ran up the one-stone doorstep into the low, dark
room. There by her deal table was Mother Barbette
and there, close beside her, licking a big iron spoon,
was Jean. A row of jars stood on the table and
Mother Barbette was covering them neatly with
white paper when Marie Josephine ran up to her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I tried not to make any noise so that you would
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>85</a></span>
be surprised,” she cried, throwing both arms around
Mother Barbette and kissing her rosy cheek.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Little Mademoiselle, you are welcome. I have
a nice little jar of jam for you and Jean, and, if I
mistake not, the kind Nannette has given you some
of her bread to eat with it!” Madame Barbette
beamed on Marie Josephine as she spoke, wiping
her hands on her clean white apron.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean put the spoon in the empty stock pot in which
the jam had been cooked and which was still hanging
on the iron crane. Then he ran over to his little
bed of oat straw in a far corner of the room and
drew out something from under the pillow. He
wore his black smock which did not show the dirt
and his black locks flapped about his face. He was
full of delight at the thought of a long afternoon
in the woods with his Little Mademoiselle.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean chatted happily as he walked beside his
friend through the dark wood aisles. Now and
again the sun would shine down in startling, golden
showers of shifting light. It was harvest time and
the scent of newly cut wheat blended with the spicy
fragrance of the forest. As they walked they
crushed wild thyme and lavender under their feet
and the sweetness of the flowers was all about them.
Jean kept glancing at Marie Josephine a little timidly.
She did not seem quite the same and he could
not make it out. He knew that she never ceased to
think of her brother Lisle in Paris and that she was
wildly impatient for the coming of Neville with
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'>86</a></span>
news. They were to have had such a delightful
afternoon in the woods, but she did not say anything
when he skipped beside her, talking of what they
would do. They had talked over all that had happened
while she had been away, of the firelight
stories Dian had told him and his mother, of the
Paris peddler who had stayed three days in Mother
Barbette’s cottage during a heavy snowstorm and
who had told them all the news of the city. Jean
had taken Marie Josephine to see the oven he had
built for her in one of their favorite nooks and they
had roasted potatoes in it. She had seemed to love
it all just as usual, this dear country of Les Vignes,
but to-day she was different.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was an afternoon of bronze leaves and sunshine,
of the noisy drowsiness of wood creatures, and of
the brooding splendor of September. When Marie
Josephine looked back at it she always thought of
sunshine between black clouds.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Shall we not have our bread and jam by the
sundial, Little Mademoiselle?” Jean asked her as
they turned down a path strewn with brown and gold
pine needles.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, that will be splendid,” she answered, and
then turning, called over her shoulder: “Flambeau,
where are you? We are going to the place you love
the best of all, the sundial!” She swung her hat by
its ribbons, throwing it up in the air and catching
it now and then. She had gathered her curls together
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>87</a></span>
into a dark coil, which bobbed over her
shoulders as she walked.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Dian is going to show us the three baby lambs
to-morrow. Do you love Dian, Little Mademoiselle?”
Jean asked, leaping along beside her, for
she had begun to run.</p>

<p class='c018'>She nodded and when she sank down at last on a
bank of moss she smiled and nodded again.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I love Dian because grandfather thought so
much of him. He once said, 'Some people in this
world are different and Dian is one of them!’ That
is the reason that we love to hear his stories!”</p>

<p class='c018'>They sat facing the sundial. There was no place
that they loved so well as this quiet nook in the
heart of a dense wood. No one really knew exactly
how the sundial came to be there. The story was
that an ancestor had wished to be alone with time
and had had this place made for himself, where he
used to spend long hours writing who knows what,
perhaps verses, soliloquies, essays. At any rate, the
sundial still stood in the heart of the wood and the
gardener kept the brush from growing too close to it.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You have not told me one fairy story since you
came this time,” Jean reproached his friend as he
opened the little green basket and brought out the
jam and the croissants.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I told you of the noises of Paris and how I lay
awake and listened to them, of how Rosanne and I
went to the fancy dress ball and hid in the balcony
and watched the others dance. I told you about
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>88</a></span>
the funny café in the old green mill and the dark
woman who made us the omelette. Why do you
want fairy stories when real things are so wonderful!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean looked so meek and contrite as he sat there
on the moss bank like a little brown gnome, that
Marie Josephine laughed out loud. Jean was her
good comrade and dear friend, but she loved to tease
him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Let us talk about Neville while we eat the croissants
and jam. I can just picture him riding in
through the gates. You and I will run to meet him,
Jean. He will be covered with dust because he has
ridden so fast. He will have a big packet of letters
in his pocket for us all and he will bring news of
maman and Lisle. Oh, perhaps he will bring word
that they are coming soon.” Marie Josephine
clasped her hands together in her earnestness. Then
she took a bite of the croissants and jam and said
something to Jean which so surprised him that he
sat bolt upright on the moss and stared at her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I wish you weren’t such a very little boy, Jean.
I wish you were old enough to plan and do things,
and that you knew about something besides squirrels
and jam and playing in the woods!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean’s eyes snapped and his lips trembled.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am not a baby, Little Mademoiselle, truly I’m
not,” he answered, but, as though in contradiction
of his words, two big tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine jumped up and came and sat
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>89</a></span>
down beside him, leaning back so that her hand
rested on the grey stone base of the sundial. A field
rabbit popped out from a clump of hedges near
them, twinkled his ears, and vanished into the underbrush.
Jean smiled through his tears, and wiped his
eyes with his jacket.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I didn’t mean to be unkind. You can’t help
being young, of course, only you don’t seem to wake
up.” Marie Josephine leaned toward him eagerly
as she spoke. “I can’t express what I mean. They
all think I’m a baby, too, at Les Vignes—Le Pont
and Hortense, all of them except Cécile—but I think
more than they do and I know things that they don’t
know, things about which grandfather thought and
told me. You and I have always been such friends
and I know I can tell you anything. There is something
that I may have to do sometime—— Oh, I
don’t know, probably not, but if I should do this
thing, you are the only one who will know!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean’s tears disappeared. He smiled at his friend,
and nodded his head vigorously when she asked,
“You’ll stand by me and keep my secret if I tell you
what I may do, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“You may trust me always, Little Mademoiselle.
We are, as you say, great friends. We have had
many good times together,” he went on wistfully.
“You do not forget me even in the great city.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Of course I do not, stupide! What if one day
we should have an adventure, you and I! What if
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>90</a></span>
we should be in great peril and have all sorts of
thrilling escapes!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“They did in the old days,” put in Jean eagerly.
“They were always being rescued. You know how
it is in some of Dian’s stories!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine stood up.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It must be time to go and meet Dian. We never
want to miss that. See how the shadows have
lengthened. Come, Jean!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean picked up the little green basket and they
went on through a long, straight wood path, looking
back every now and then at the grey sundial in its
patch of light.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The sundial looks lonely, does it not? It has
no friends but us!” Jean exclaimed, waving his hand
at it.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are a dear, funny boy, Jean, my little
brother. Come, let’s run!” As she spoke Marie
Josephine caught hold of Jean’s hand and they fairly
flew along the path, out into the great, wide, sweeping
meadows. They ran on down a long lane, past
the great barns, pausing at the last one to gaze inside
where the sun sifting in on the grain made a glowing
picture of grey and gold. They watched the great
sieves, hung between poles, bending backward and
forward, winnowing the grain from the chaff. Then
they went on more slowly down the lane and, turning
to the right, they saw suddenly the vast countryside
and in the distance a slowly moving grey mass
which was really the sheep coming home from pasture.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_91' id='Page_91'>91</a></span>
They waved their hands at a tall figure walking
with the sheep and ran toward it, through the
fields. The air was luminous. There were flecks
of gold in the sky. It was like flying through space,
this running across the meadows to meet Dian and
his sheep.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Isn’t it good, Dian! Isn’t this a fairy evening?”
Marie Josephine called happily as they came up to
the shepherd. Dian answered with a slow smile:</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is good indeed, Little Mademoiselle. There
is nothing in the wide world so good as a meadow
at sunset.” Indeed, as he walked through the tufted
meadow grass in his grey smock, his tall figure outlined
against the gleaming stacks of wheat, he himself
seemed a part of the radiant evening.</p>

<p class='c018'>Flambeau walked gingerly over the uneven
ground, his eyes and ears alert for field rabbits.
Jean and Marie Josephine walked one on each side
of the shepherd.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Jean and I had our goûter by the sundial. I’ve
been talking to him about growing up. He is so
young! He thinks of nothing but the woods and
birds. He knows nothing of all that is happening
in the world!” As Marie Josephine spoke, Dian
turned toward her, smiling his slow, sweet smile.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is well that he does not know too much. This
is good for him to know, just this,” the shepherd
said, as he looked about him at the pasture lands
with the grey sheepfold beyond, the deepening rose
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>92</a></span>
of the sky, and the zigzagging grey mass of sheep
before them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is good, Dian,” Marie Josephine laughed up
at him. “I am so happy now, and this afternoon I
was so sad.”</p>

<p class='c018'>They had come to the sheepfold paling and Jean
ran forward to help Dian open the great door. Vif,
the sheep dog, ran around and around barking his
orders vigorously and scolding the lagging ones
who wanted just one more nibble of the sweet grass
before being closed in for the night.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The cigales have stopped buzzing, so that means
summer is gone, doesn’t it, Dian?” asked Jean as
they pushed back the gate together.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, and it means that the green crickets will
be here soon, harvest will be over, and winter will
come.” As he spoke the shepherd looked off at the
horizon, and a look not so much of sadness as of
great seriousness came into his face.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I must run back, for it is time for Proté to dress
me for supper. We are going to have it outdoors
to-night as a treat.” Marie Josephine looked wistfully
at Jean as she spoke. She would have so enjoyed
his company at the evening meal under the
stars, out on the wide terrace, but Jean did not seem
to be at all envious of the outdoor supper at Les
Vignes.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are to come to see us to-night, Dian. You
shall have some of the new fig jam,” Jean called
over his shoulder to the shepherd. Then as he went
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>93</a></span>
on through the wood with Marie Josephine he said
happily:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Mother will set the little table out under the big
pine by the red well if I ask her to!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“You will have a picnic, too, and I would rather
go to it than to ours. Good-bye, Jean, until to-morrow.”
Marie Josephine was off like a flash toward
the great house which loomed before them as they
made a sudden turning in the wood path.</p>

<p class='c018'>She ran in at the stone lion-guarded entrance door,
up a great flight of stone stairs, and into a big room
on the right at the top of the stairs. Proté stood
by the window looking out, but on seeing her little
charge she came forward hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Martin says supper must be early because of the
nights getting cold. It was Madame le Pont’s
order. You must wear something warm over your
frock. That was her order, too.” While she spoke
Proté brushed out Marie Josephine’s curls in front
of a long, gilded mirror which hung back of the
dressing table. There were two silver candleholders
which held lighted candles, one on each side of the
glass. Marie Josephine smiled at Proté’s face in
the mirror.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll wear Great-aunt Hortense’s shawl, you
know the one she gave me to keep until I’m grown-up.
Let’s talk about the bal masqué, Proté. Wasn’t
it splendid of Rosanne to come for me that way with
Gonfleur! I want to see Rosanne. I’ve so many
things to tell her!”</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>94</a></span>
“It may be, Little Mademoiselle, that she will
have a great many things to tell you!” Proté’s round
face looked solemn as she spoke. Marie Josephine
looked at her more seriously in the looking-glass.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes,” she answered slowly. “Yes, of course, I
suppose she will. She is in Paris. Doesn’t it seem
strange, Proté, when it’s so sweet and quiet here in
Pigeon Valley, to think of Paris?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Proté shrugged her shoulders and raised both
hands, hairbrush and all.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is best not to think of it at all,” she said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I must think of it, Proté. Maman is there and
Lisle. Do you think Neville will come in a few days,
Proté? Do say that you do!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“God grant it, Little Mademoiselle!” Proté answered.</p>

<p class='c018'>They all smiled at Marie Josephine when she
appeared ready for the outdoor supper with Great-aunt
Hortense’s shawl over her white dress. It was
a scarlet crêpe shawl, heavily embroidered in white
fleur de lys, and it was so long that it almost completely
covered her. She threw one end of it around
her shoulder and walked majestically down the
terrace steps.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You did that well, Marie Josephine. It was
quite like mother’s Spanish friend at the opera,”
Bertran du Monde said to her, taking her arm and
bowing mockingly as they went toward the supper
table. This was unusual praise from Bertran, who
generally quarreled with her.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'>95</a></span>
“You think you can make me believe that you
were ever allowed to go to your aunt’s box at the
opera at night!” returned Marie Josephine. It was
something she had wanted so very much to do
herself.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I have been several times. Is that not so,
Cécile?” Bertran answered, appealing to his sister,
who had just come up to them with Madame le
Pont and Hortense.</p>

<p class='c018'>Cécile nodded smilingly.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a merry supper party, for somehow everyone
seemed to be in good humor. Bertran pretended
to be quite overcome at being the only gentleman
among so many grand ladies. He sat at the foot
of the table and Hortense at the head. She was
lovely in rose-dotted silk, her wide skirts fluttering
about her in the light wind, a fichu of thread lace
fastened at her breast. Cécile was lovely, too, in
her pale green, her golden hair dressed high as she
had worn it at the bal masqué. Denise and Marie
Josephine sat one on each side of the governess,
both in white except for the gorgeous red of Marie’s
shawl. Bertran had changed from his riding clothes
into blue velvet trunks and waistcoat. His stiff black
hair was fastened with a huge black velvet bow.
The buckles on his velvet slippers sparkled like
diamonds. They all laughed at him because he had
put a black patch over his left eyebrow in imitation
of a grown-up man-about-town. His face was so
round and fat and he looked so young that such a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>96</a></span>
very grown-up affair as a patch amused them all,
especially Marie Josephine.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We all know you are fourteen and that you will
not be a Grand Seigneur for a great many years.”
Marie Josephine smiled sweetly across at Bertran
as she spoke and emphasized <i>great</i>.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Is that so, Mademoiselle Spitfire,” Bertran answered,
helping himself to salad as old Martin
passed it to him. He spoke good-naturedly.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was a wide silver candelabra in the center
of the table, covered with a gold-colored silk shade.
The delicate dishes and the silver flashed in the soft
light. Above them the stars twinkled a good evening
and a big, round September moon looked down.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Is there no news of Neville, Martin?” Madame
le Pont asked the old butler as he removed the cloth
and put some silver dishes of nuts and a green bowl
full of purple grapes on the table.</p>

<p class='c018'>“No news, Madame, but it is early yet to-night,”
Martin answered.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I would not worry so much, Madame. It is
bad traveling now and you know Neville may not
have been able to get fresh mounts,” Bertran said
to the governess with his most grown-up air.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Do let us talk of something else. I’m so tired of
having some one ask every five minutes if there is
news of Neville,” Denise said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Madame le Pont broke a bunch of grapes on her
plate and ate one slowly. “We must hope for the
best,” she said and they all laughed.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>97</a></span>
“You always say that Le Pont, darling, you
know.” Marie Josephine put her hand caressingly
on the governess’s arm as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I threw pennies to the hovel children outside the
gates as Denise and I rode through the demesne.
It was fun to see them grabbing in the dust for them.
One of them, a tall, lanky boy, fairly wallowed in
dust! I tell you, Madame, I laughed to see them,
and wished I had more pennies for them,” Bertran
said to the governess.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is no town where they can buy things,
but when the bailiff comes to oversee, he will give
them bread if they have money, poor things,”
Madame le Pont answered.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine sat silently looking up at the
stars for a moment. It was Grigge of whom Bertran
had spoken, Grigge who was Jean’s cousin.</p>

<p class='c018'>Martin had poured some sparkling yellow wine
into the tall, thin glasses and Bertran stood up
suddenly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“To His Majesty, King Louis of France,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c018'>The others rose to their feet and said, “His
Majesty the King.” Then they drank a little of
the wine and sat down again.</p>

<p class='c018'>They did not see that some one was coming
slowly from the dark shrubbery at the side of the
terrace. Martin saw him first and dropped a dish
of apricots. Then the children and Madame le
Pont all saw him at once, as he came up to the table.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>98</a></span>
He was a bearded man in ragged clothes, a red cap
on his head. They all sat perfectly still watching
him, not one of them cried out. It was Bertran who
spoke first. He stood up and faced the man.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Who are you and what do you want?”</p>

<p class='c018'>The man did not answer and Bertran said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Leave the presence of the ladies at once or I
shall call the men on the place.” Bertran was
frightened, but did his best to make his voice manly
and convincing.</p>

<p class='c018'>Suddenly Marie Josephine jumped up from the
table, and ran up to the stranger.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Why, don’t you know him? It’s Neville!” she
cried. There was a half sob in her voice. Neville
had come back. How was it that the others had not
recognized him? She had known him by his eyes
at once.</p>

<p class='c018'>He spoke and then they all knew him. Bowing
to the governess, he said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Your pardon, Madame, but unless I came in
this disguise there was no way for me to come at
all. I did not change before seeing you because it
is best that you note well my disguise so that you
will all know me again.”</p>

<p class='c018'>His voice trembled and he sank on to a chair which
old Martin pushed forward.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Martin, bread and hot soup at once! The man
is famished and exhausted. Bertran, pour some
wine. There, that is well.” The governess came
to Neville’s side and held the wine to his lips.</p>
<div id='illus09' class='figcenter'>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>99</a></span>
Martin went for food and the others, filled with
concern and interest, came up close to Neville.</p>

<p class='c018'>When he could speak, Neville looked at Madame
le Pont and said faintly:</p>

<p class='c018'>“I would see you alone, Madame!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then it seemed as though they all spoke at once,
crowding up to his chair.</p>

<p class='c018'>“No, no, Neville, tell us also. Tell us all there
is to know!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell us that maman and Lisle are well and safe.”
Marie Josephine put her arm on Neville’s ragged
coat as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Safe,” he answered. “Safe enough so far and
there seems to be no real danger for them yet, but
the city—ah, Madame, the city!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, yes, tell us. What of the city?” It was
the governess who spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Marat has control of everything. They have
taken twenty thousand stand of arms from the homes
of royalists and most of the royalists who could
escape have done so, but now the city gates are
closely guarded. The comtesse and Monsieur
Lisle will not leave because, for one reason, your
great-aunt, the Marquise du Ganne, is old and ailing.
She cannot escape, and they could not leave
her in the city as it is now. More than that, we see
no way for them to escape, even if it should be that
Madame du Ganne should not live!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Neville fumbled in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I have a letter to you all from Madame la
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>100</a></span>
Comtesse and there is a note for Little Mademoiselle
from Monsieur Lisle. It was not really
safe to bring them but I took the risk.”</p>

<p class='c018'>He brought out the two notes, handing one to
Madame le Pont and the other to Marie Josephine,
who caught it and held it close to her heart, the red
shawl falling to the ground at her feet unheeded.
She opened it and read:</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='sc'>To My Sister Marie Josephine</span>: Maman and
I are deeply interested in the progress of our royalist
armies and the good news that Austria has promised
aid. This troublesome time is but for the moment. We
are very comfortable with Henri to take care of us. How
is Flambeau? My respects to Madame and the girls and
greetings to Dian. See to it that you are patient and
unafraid.</p>

<div class='c020'>My love to you,</div>
<div class='c021'>Lisle Georges Montfleur Saint Frère.</div>

<p class='c018'><i>Postscript.</i> Tell Dian I will have some stories to
match his one day.</p>

<p class='c018'>As Marie Josephine stood there under the stars,
the letter clasped in her hands, the words that her
mother had spoken on the morning that they had
left for Les Vignes came back to her: “There may
come a time later on when it will not be so easy to
get away!”</p>

  <h2 id='ch08' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter VIII</span> <br /> <br />HUMPHREY TRAIL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“Minuit!”</p>

<p class='c018'>A little girl peered through the gloom of a dark
alley, toward the rue Saint Antoine. Her thin,
eager face looked anxious and her black eyes darted
here and there in search of him who until very recently
had been her best friend in all the world,
Minuit, an alley cat!</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s time to go to bed, ma mie. Come to Vivi,”
she called again and suddenly from out of the greyness
of the deserted alley, a gaunt, long shape appeared.
It was Minuit and when he saw Vivi he
ran up to her with a welcoming meow. She stooped
and gathered him into her arms, hugging him close
to her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ve been alone all day, for the fat, funny man
told me I’d best stay inside to-day. He will be
coming soon with my supper.” While she was
speaking she was making her way back to an open
door through which a faint light was gleaming. She
was so used to being alone with Minuit that she
found it natural to talk to him as though he were
a person.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>102</a></span>
A jangle of rough voices came down the alley
from the shoemaker’s shop on the corner of the rue
Saint Antoine. Vivi was not at all frightened of
the voices or their owners, for she knew them.
They had been friends of her father and he would
have been with them, talking far into the night, had
he not been killed the summer before by some pieces
of lumber from the big pavilion falling on him. The
pavilion had been erected after the storming of the
Tuileries and he had been one of hundreds who had
offered to help put it up. He was a licorice water
seller by profession and all that he had left Vivi of
worldly goods was his tin tray and the cups dangling
from it. She hoped to make some sous in the spring
selling the cooling drink in the streets. Now that
the cold weather had come, no one was thirsty
enough to drink licorice water, and if it had not
been for the fat, foreign stranger, who had taken
the room above her and who never failed to bring
her something to eat when he came in at night,
she would have had to go down the alley to beg a
bit of bread from the shoemaker.</p>

<p class='c018'>She went through the open door, climbed a short
flight of rickety stairs, and opened a door at the
right of the first landing. The room she entered
was small and bare. There was a cot in one corner
covered with a piece of sacking, a deal table close
to a tiny, rude fireplace, and a chair. Some pieces
of a broken box lay on the floor near the fireplace.
Vivi went over to the cot and put Minuit down on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>103</a></span>
it. Then she went over to the cupboard and threw
open its rickety door. There was nothing at all to
eat in the cupboard and Vivi made a face at it.
She had never heard of Mother Hubbard, but she
must have felt very much like her as she saw the
bare boards and heard Minuit’s entreating meow.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Never mind, Minuit, the fat man will bring us
something to eat. Let us go to sleep under the sacking
until he comes.” She picked Minuit up in her
arms as she spoke and going to the cot, curled up on
it under the sacking. Before she knew it, she and
her purring friend were fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c018'>Vivi was awakened by a loud scrambling of rats.
She could hear them fighting and chasing each other
through the wall as she sat up on the cot and rubbed
her eyes. She jumped up and, drawing the cot
close to the dusty window with its small jagged
corner of broken glass, leaned forward so that she
could see down the alley as far as the rue Saint
Antoine at the end of it. She did not have to wait
very long before she saw a short, stout figure in a
long cloak and wide hat coming toward her through
the dusk.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was the figure of Humphrey Trail, or “the fat,
funny man,” as Vivi spoke of him to Minuit. He
gave a little knock on the door and came in, bringing
a rush of cold wind with him. He had a bundle
in his arms and going over to the table he put it
down, yawned, and looked at Vivi. She came slowly
toward him, trying not to look too eagerly at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>104</a></span>
table. Her rough black hair flapped about her
face as she pulled up a chair for him. When he
had sat down in it, she jumped up on the table
beside him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I told Minuit you would bring something,” she
said, smiling at him. He smiled back at her, opening
the bundle which was done up in brown paper.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Food we shall have, tha and I and tha friend
th’ cat,” said Humphrey, tearing off the paper and
bringing forth its contents, a loaf of bread and a
hunk of cheese. He felt in his pocket and drawing
out his big jackknife, cut a generous slice of the
bread and a good supply of cheese. He put the
cheese astride the bread and handed it to his little
friend with a bow.</p>

<p class='c018'>Vivi nodded her gratitude. She was too busy
taking big bites out of the bread and cheese to thank
Humphrey in words. He was well pleased at her
enjoyment of the simple meal and took his own
share with a relish. Minuit was not forgotten
either and ate his portion greedily. Humphrey
spoke to him apologetically.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tha shall have tha dish o’ milk one day when
milk is easier got, beastie,” he said. Minuit, who
had not tasted milk since the days of his infancy,
did not seem to be at all put out because of the
present lack of the beverage. He jumped up on to
the table beside Vivi and began to lick his paws.
Humphrey Trail balanced himself uncomfortably
on the rickety chair as he ate his supper. He had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>105</a></span>
had only a bowl of hot soup in a small café on the
rue Royale at noon, and he was as hungry as his two
companions. As he ate he thought deeply and
hardly heeded Vivi when she went over to the cot.
His French was so limited that they could only hold
brief conversations.</p>

<p class='c018'>Minuit gave Humphrey’s arm a soft bump with
his head to remind him that he was holding an uneaten
bit of cheese in his hand. Humphrey gave
him the cheese, accompanied by a pat on the head.
Then he relapsed into thoughtfulness again. He sat
a long time at the deal table with his plump, round
face propped up on his two hands. He was thinking
of Lisle Saint Frère and of the great house where
he lived and of all that had passed since he had
snatched the boy from the spinner’s cart, when he
had called out, “God save King Louis!” What
awful things had happened in Paris since that night
of the tenth of August when the gallant Marseillais
had stormed the Tuileries and awakened Paris to
action! Ah, that had been a great day for the people!
They were worth-while men, those Marseillais
who had cheered their long march across France
with their own songs, who had come in their simplicity
and valor to avenge their wrongs, to start
a new era of liberty for the people, but who had
not known, alas! that innocent people would so
cruelly suffer, that Paris would go mad.</p>

<p class='c018'>He had made his decision to remain in Paris on
that August night, as he paced up and down his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'>106</a></span>
room at the Croix d’Or. He would stay on, even
if his staying might mean his death. His heart
bled for the people of France who had been starved
and taxed and unjustly treated for centuries and he
had rejoiced when he heard the new song of liberty
shouted in the streets:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Allons enfants de la patrie,</div>
      <div class='line'>Le jour de gloire est arrive!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey would have answered, if any one had
asked him, that he had remained in France to “see
the fun,” but this was not so. There was Vivi, who
depended on him for her daily bread, and there was
some one else who might need his help also. He
knew in his own mind that it was greatly because
of this some one else that he had decided to stay.
The some one else was Lisle.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey roused himself and got up, wrapped
the bread and cheese carefully in brown paper, and,
going over to the cupboard, put them on a shelf.
It made him happy to supply food for little Vivi.
He had come across her in a strange way. He had
witnessed the accident at the pavilion which had
caused the death of her father. The poor man had
been selling his licorice water when the timbers from
the pavilion fell on him. While some one went to
get a cart in which to take him to a hospital,
Humphrey held the man in his arms and spoke to
him in his poor French. Afterward he had visited
him at the hospital, and just before the man died,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>107</a></span>
promised to look after his little girl. Humphrey
had picked up the man’s tray and tin cups and given
them to Vivi. He moved into the attic room above
hers, so as to be able to look after her. His good
action proved a safeguard to himself, for all
foreigners at inns were being questioned and put
under suspicion, and his days at the Croix d’Or
would have been numbered had he remained.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey had sat down again at the table and he
remained there for a long time, deep in thought.
Suddenly he was startled by sounds of wild laughter
and shouting from the rue Saint Antoine, as groups
of citizens danced by. They were shouting a new
and terrible song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dansons la Carmagnole,</div>
      <div class='line'>Vive le son du canon!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey stood up, wrapped his snuff-colored
cloak about him, and picking up his wide hat, went
out, closing the door softly behind him. He made
his way through the alley to the noisy rue Saint
Antoine and went on swiftly through the dark,
wintry streets. Everywhere were hurrying masses
of people. Snatches of the “Ça Ira,” the favorite
song of the crowds, could be heard on all sides and
wild, dark faces under scarlet caps peered out of
the gloom. He turned in at a brightly lighted
shop on the rue Royale. It was the bakery shop
where he had bought for Vivi the first cake that she
had ever eaten. Now he wanted to buy her another.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>108</a></span>
On the first days of his visit to the great city,
Humphrey had come to this bakery several times,
in order to indulge in his love for sweets. It had
once been very fashionable. Less than a year before,
it had been filled with smart lackeys, who carried
charming boxes of maroons or candied grapes
to their ladies’ sedan chairs. Now no such finery
was seen. Instead the shop was patronized by
honest farmer people from the country and rich
merchants of the city who were heart and soul in
sympathy with the revolution, never dreaming that
their turn to suffer was coming soon.</p>

<p class='c018'>The baker woman still sold her neat rows of
cherry tarts. On the wooden gallery above, talkative
groups drank their eau citron and enjoyed the
good cakes. Humphrey eyed the pile of puffy
brioche set out on a tray next to a gleaming pile of
fruit confits, and he wondered what to buy for Vivi.
He felt guilty in buying anything but bread, but he
could not resist the pleasure he would be giving
Vivi, who had never had any sweets in all her life.
Humphrey admired Vivi because she had been so
brave when her father died, and because she could
smile when she was hungry!</p>

<p class='c018'>As he stood there undecided, the shop door
opened with a clang, and turning his head, Humphrey
saw a boy enter and stand near him at the
counter. After a moment, he realized that it was
Lisle. He wore a shabby black suit which had evidently
belonged to a groom, his locks were tied back
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>109</a></span>
with a bit of black tape, and the cap which he held
in his hands was a dismal, ragged one. He was
evidently attempting a disguise, but it was a poor
one, and when Humphrey heard him ask the woman
for the cakes, his heart sank. Lisle’s attempt to
change his voice was more futile than his attempt to
change his garb.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I want a cake for a little girl, citizen, something
simple but very good,” Lisle said to the bakery
woman.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You want a cake, do you!” she waved her hand
above a tray of cream pastries, surrounded by green
“cauliflowers” of almond flavor. Her black eyes
took in his appearance as she cried her wares.
“Here are tartlets, choufleur. Choose what you
will!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey felt an odd mixture of emotion as he
stood there with his back to Lisle. Lisle was a large
part of his adventure, and his chief reason for staying
on in Paris. He had never forgotten the sight
of the boy on top of the spinner’s cart, waving his
cap and shouting for the king. He had been sent
to be his friend. The little incident that occurred
when he had let Lisle go his way, after he had rescued
him, had made him sure of it. He had watched
Lisle and seen him stop and start back, then pause
uncertainly and go on again. Something in the action
touched Humphrey’s big heart. The boy had
needed his counsel, but his pride and independence
had forbidden his asking it. Since then Humphrey
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>110</a></span>
had gone each night and stood for an hour in the
shadow of the wall at the side of the great house of
the Saint Frères.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What cakes will you choose? My time is not
forever at your disposal,” the bakery woman said
impatiently.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle regarded the cakes soberly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I want something simple for a little girl,” he
repeated.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I have just the thing, a plain sponge with white
icing. You shall see.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The woman moved away to reach the cakes at
the back of a shelf just behind her. Lisle turned
round and, seeing Humphrey Trail, at once gave
him a smile of greeting. Humphrey made no sign
of recognition. The woman returned with the cakes
saying:</p>

<p class='c018'>“They are three sous apiece. How many?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle answered, “I wish to have three.” He put
his hand in the pocket of his rough over-jacket and,
drawing forth some coins, counted out the desired
amount and handed it to the woman. When she had
given him the small package he went out. Without
waiting to buy his cake, Humphrey Trail followed
him.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey was angry as he walked out of the
bakery shop. They were a little in awe of him at
home in the farmlands when his easy-going temper
was aroused. He came up to Lisle and spoke to
him without ceremony.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>111</a></span>
“Th’ art mad, lad, I tell thee, to buy cakes at a
shop where spies eat and there are eyes in every
corner. Th’ art a poor fool at play actin’ with tha
soft speech and ways. Get tha home and, for tha
mother’s sake, stay within tha house!”</p>

<p class='c018'>They had walked slowly along the crowded rue
Royale. Lisle turned and looked at his companion
and suddenly he smiled.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I like you, Humphrey Trail,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey felt his temper cooling, and as they
turned into a quieter street he slackened his pace.
Nothing could have happened more timely than
Humphrey’s losing his temper. Had there been any
vestige of suspicion as to Humphrey’s sincerity in
Lisle’s mind, it vanished forever with his honest
scolding.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I like tha well myself, lad, but see that tha ken
sense with tha manly ways,” Humphrey said in
answer.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is the first time I have been there, Humphrey
Trail. Our friend, Rosanne de Soigné, is staying
with my mother and me. I was buying cakes for
her.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Th’ little girl can do well without sweets these
sad days if it will save her life,” he answered. As
he spoke a deep sense of responsibility fell on him
and then he felt a warm glow of thankfulness that
the boy trusted him and was confiding in him.</p>

<p class='c018'>They had reached the Saint Frère house and Lisle
turned and held out his hand.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>112</a></span>
“I have been glad of your company, Humphrey
Trail. I know you are honest, and just now there
is no one else in all Paris whom I can trust.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tha can trust me, lad, that tha can. Can tha
remember the name of my lodging? Listen well. It
is in the Impasse Forné, just off the rue Saint
Antoine, the fourth turn to the right from the corner
where the women are making waste for the guns.
Tha cannot fail to find it and any message sent there
will reach me. I shall not be far and I shall be ready
to serve tha well.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey shook Lisle’s hand warmly there in
the shadow of the great house.</p>

<p class='c018'>“In all Paris, you are my only friend, Humphrey
Trail,” Lisle answered.</p>

  <h2 id='ch09' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter IX</span> <br /> <br />DIAN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Dian the shepherd was always welcome at
Mother Barbette’s fire. He sat before it on a chilly
December afternoon, warming his hands at a piled-up
heap of briskly-burning fagots. Jean had gathered
them during the autumn months, and they were
stacked in neat piles in the back of the room. Rows
of onions were strung on lines along the ceiling, and
there were bowls of good fig jam on a shelf by the
door. Mother Barbette was prepared for what she
felt would be a hard winter.</p>

<p class='c018'>She was making a stew for supper and she was
wishing that it might have been a good one. She
peered into the stock pot above the fire and sighed.
It was not a savory mixture that met her eyes. The
stew was made mostly of hot water and pieces of
bread, to which she had added a cup of milk, some
salt, and a bit of garlic. She had eaten the stew all
her life, but always before she had had a piece of
veal or pork to add to it.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian the shepherd sniffed the stew delightedly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s good to know that there will soon be food,”
he said. He often shared the Barbettes’ supper and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'>114</a></span>
sometimes brought them meat which he obtained
from a near-by farmer in exchange for some of the
cheese for which he himself was famous. He never
ate meat but seemed content always with a cup of
milk and a piece of bread.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are always of good heart and seem content
with anything that comes your way, Dian.” Mother
Barbette poured some soup into a blue bowl as she
spoke and handed it to the shepherd. He took it,
bowing his head over it and closing his eyes for a
moment. Then he ate it slowly, the firelight playing
on his long, straggling, red locks and work-worn
hands and lighting up his earnest, bronzed face.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There’s a quietness about you, Dian. You are
one of few words, but, if I mistake not, you think
more than the most of us,” Mother Barbette continued.
She sat down on a stool by the fire and
began to mend Jean’s little coat.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There will be snow soon,” the shepherd gave
answer. He ate his stew slowly, for he was thinking
deeply. He did not notice that Jean had come into
the room until the boy came close to the fire. Then
he made room for him on the settle.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell us a good tale, please, Dian,” pleaded Jean,
snuggling up to the shepherd, for the cold wind blew
through the little house and, even by the fire, it
searched out one’s toes and ears.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mother Barbette eyed her son severely.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is never a moment of the day that you
think of aught but to amuse yourself. You can do
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'>115</a></span>
little more than read and write, and you can thank
Dian that you accomplish even that much.” Mother
Barbette spoke with feeling. It seemed as though
Jean would never grow up, he was so merry of heart
and so untouched by trouble. Her heart was sad
enough, for she knew that, since Neville had come
back two months previous, there had been no message
from Madame Saint Frère and Lisle. They
were hoping daily for the coming of another messenger.
Dian had spoken of snow. That would
mean bad traveling! Mother Barbette sighed as she
patched the little coat. She knew that, though there
were stores in the cellars at Les Vignes, there was
very little ready money.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was a sudden rap on the door. An instant
later it opened, and in ran Marie Josephine. Mother
Barbette rose to her feet and came toward the child,
a look of concern on her broad face.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Little Mademoiselle, what is it? You have come
alone through the wood!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian stood up, and Jean jumped about the room
in sheer delight, for Marie Josephine laughed as
she gave Mother Barbette a hug.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I came for some fun,” she said, “and because I
was tired of them all, even of Cécile, that is, not of
her, but of her long face. You are not to scold me,
dear Mother Barbette, because I ran alone through
the woods.” She danced over to Dian and went on
speaking eagerly. “I am glad that you are here,
Dian. Jean and I were saying only the other day
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'>116</a></span>
that it was so long since you had told us a story, not
since we went last to meet you when you came home
from the pasture. I will sit on one side of you and
Jean on the other, and if we are very good, will you
not tell us something?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian smiled a slow smile that lighted up his face
and sat down again on the settle. Marie Josephine
and Jean snuggled down on each side of him, and
Mother Barbette went over to her stool, took up the
coat and her needle and darning cotton, and smiled
across at them. The Little Mademoiselle could
only stay with them a short time, for she would soon
be missed at Les Vignes, but it was a blessing to have
her there with them. Mother Barbette’s kind heart
swelled with love for the two playmates sitting beside
the good shepherd. She had been right when she
had said that Dian was a man of few words, but one
who thought a great deal. Many of his thoughts
he told to the children when they walked back with
him to the sheepfold. Marie Josephine often
thought of these walks with Dian during the long,
sedate months in Paris in the winter. Sometimes
she could almost smell the sweetness of the tufted
meadow and hear the evening call of the larks.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian sat quietly in the firelight, his black, smocklike
apron falling about his knees.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You would have a tale, would you, Little Mademoiselle,
you and Jean? Then it shall be as you
will. I will tell you of what I was thinking as I
walked back from the hill crest to-night and while
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'>117</a></span>
I was fastening the sheepfold gate.” He paused a
moment and, as he sat gazing into the flames, there
was a look of great earnestness in his eyes, and of
great sadness, too.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, yes! tell us, good Dian, tell us. We love
your stories, Jean and I. We often talk of them
together and we never forget any of them—'The
Purple Sun’ and 'The Grey Hill’ and 'The Waterfall
That Sang’—we love every one of them.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine sat back contentedly. Nothing
could happen to Lisle, nothing in the world. They
would all be together in the spring. She knew that
the governess and the older girls talked together very
seriously when she was not present. Even her beloved
Cécile seemed grave and preoccupied, and she
felt that she did not confide in her any more. Denise
and Bertran still rode gaily through the demesne
and danced in the great drawing-room at Les Vignes
in the evening. She was more and more with Jean.
She knew that Lisle would be disgusted with her if
she moped about, so she tried to be as happy as she
could. She was really happy this cold November
night, enjoying the little adventure of having run
away to the cottage.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I hope they will worry and fuss about me,” she
thought to herself, which was of course very naughty
of her. Then she closed her eyes there in the soft
firelight and listened to Dian’s story.</p>

<p class='c018'>“This isn’t a real story, Little Mademoiselle; it
is only a fancy of mine. I was thinking to-night, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'>118</a></span>
I walked home in the sunset, of a young lad of noble
birth, who lived many years ago, here in France, in
the time of the long-ago King Louis XI. It was
the time of knights in armor and of deep dungeons.
It was a time like the present, when every man’s
hand was raised against his brother. All the long
way home it seemed as though this young lad walked
beside me. He was clothed in blue and silver and
his hair was like the corn when it is ripe. There was
a falcon on his wrist because he was one of the king’s
pages of the hunt. Many a night he had held a
torchlight for the king and had shouted, 'Hallali!’
when the greedy pack caught the poor stag. He was
a gallant youth and a brave one, though he was so
young that he had never seen sixteen years. He
loved to run with his fellow pages through the forest
at dawn and to throw the javelin with them at sunset.
He was also a true and loyal knight. One day,
because he loved his king, he was carried away to
a dungeon and no one knew where he had gone.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian stopped speaking and sat looking into the
dying fire, his hands spread out upon his knees. Jean
ran over to a wooden box by the door and came back
with his arms filled with fagots. He threw them
on the fire and the sudden burst of flames made the
pewter utensils above the mantel shine like diamonds
and brought out the crimson gleam of the woven rug
that covered Mother Barbette’s four-poster bed.
Pince Nez, the crow, who had been asleep with his
head cocked on one side, woke suddenly and gave
a solemn croak. When he croaked Mother Barbette
gave a little start and sat up. She had been fast
asleep and had not heard more than a word or two
of what Dian had been saying.</p>
<div id='illus10' class='figcenter'>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'>119</a></span>
Jean ran back to the settle after he had put on
the wood and sat down in his place by the shepherd’s
side. He smiled across at Marie Josephine with his
merry black eyes. “We like the story, do we not,
Little Mademoiselle?” he asked her. She sat looking
down at her hands which were folded in her lap.
She did not answer him or look up at him, for there
were tears in her eyes and she did not want any one
to see them. While Dian had been talking she had
been thinking with all her might. She had begun
to suspect that he was speaking of Lisle, and as he
went on she became sure of it.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There was a cowherd on the lands where the
young page lived,” Dian went on. “This cowherd
was sorely grieved at the trouble that had come to
his master. He thought of the page night and day.
He wished more than he had ever wished anything
that he might find a way to rescue him, and he whispered
the wish as a prayer to the sun and the stars.”</p>

<p class='c018'>A knock broke in on the quiet earnestness of the
shepherd’s voice and the next instant the door opened
and Neville came inside. He was wind-blown and
breathless.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are here, Little Mademoiselle, and that is
well. The young ladies and Madame le Pont were
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'>120</a></span>
uneasy about you. Madame le Pont requested me
to say that you were to come at once.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The shepherd stood up and reached for his cloak
from the back of the settle. He was a taller man
than Neville and had the look of one who had lived
always in the open, close to the secrets of beasts and
birds. Neville wore again his wig and his familiar
house uniform of red and gold. It did not seem
possible that he could ever have worn the queer,
shabby disguise in which he had come back from
Paris. He looked very pale and ill. No one but
the shepherd knew of the dire peril through which
the faithful man had passed in order to return with
the message from the comtesse and to protect the
little group at Les Vignes. Dian knew, and there
was something he had to say to him, so he put on
his cloak and went with them.</p>

<p class='c018'>The wind shrieked eerily as Marie Josephine
walked through the forest, with Neville and Dian
on each side of her. Mother Barbette had wrapped
her cloak about her and pulled the cape up over her
curls. She walked quietly, holding Dian’s hand so
that he might steady her steps over the fallen
branches of trees or the sudden twists of roots here
and there. Neville’s lanthorn cast a dancing light
ahead of them.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine was thinking deeply. Could it
be that she was the same laughing, mischievous girl
who had run away after dinner, leaving the others
in the great firelit drawing-room? She had tried to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'>121</a></span>
be happy because she could not believe that anything
could happen to those she loved. Now, suddenly,
she was awake, and because it was her nature to do
things thoroughly she was very much awake indeed.
She knew, as she walked back under the moonless
sky toward Les Vignes, where the lights shone
faintly, that she would never be the same little girl
again. Dian had been speaking of Lisle. He had
not said so, but she knew it. Dian felt that Lisle
was in danger. There was no use in being happy or
playing in the woods with Jean any longer. She
must be awake. It might be that there was something
she could do!</p>

<p class='c018'>She heard the clock strike eleven that night, and
then twelve. She had lain awake for three hours
listening to the thin branches of walnut trees swishing
and flapping against her windows. When the
clock struck twelve she sat up in bed and listened.
She had opened the window a little way because she
loved to feel the sweet, chill wind. She heard voices
quite distinctly by the side of the house. Some one
spoke in a low tone, and a voice answered that she
knew right away was Dian’s.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is right that I should be the one to go. I have
left a message for the governess. Tell her not to
fear. I shall reach them sometime safely.” Whether
because the wind changed freakishly, or because the
voices had gone on down the driveway, Marie Josephine
did not hear another word. She jumped out
of bed and ran to the window and, kneeling, peered
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'>122</a></span>
out. There was no one about, and she did not hear
anything now, except the moan of the forest and
the wail of the wind.</p>

<p class='c018'>She turned her head as she knelt against the window
casement and there, coming toward her, was
Cécile. How it happened Marie Josephine did not
quite know, but the next moment she was sobbing
with Cécile’s arms about her. Before she realized
it she was in bed, tucked up warmly, with Cécile close
beside her. She told Cécile of Dian’s story and then
of the words she had just overheard, and she knew
that Cécile was very excited though she spoke quietly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Do you think it can be that Dian has gone to-night
to Paris? Do you think that is what I overheard,
Cécile?” Marie Josephine asked her friend,
who answered steadily:</p>

<p class='c018'>“I think that Dian has gone, and we must pray
that he can help them.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Cécile’s long braid of fair hair fell across her
shoulders over her velvet robe. She put her face
down on the pillow beside Marie Josephine and they
both lay looking out at the late moon which showed
fleetingly through white clouds.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I thought you had deserted me for your little
friend Jean. You seemed happy, just playing with
him, and I was glad for you, but I have missed your
company so much of late,” Cécile said softly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I thought you’d rather be with the others, and
that you look upon me as a baby, the way the rest
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_123' id='Page_123'>123</a></span>
do,” Marie Josephine answered with a sob, putting
her arms around Cécile.</p>

<p class='c018'>“No, Marie, I sometimes think of you as being
the oldest of us all, and the wisest. You think and
dream when we are only sitting by and sewing. Perhaps
it is because you are so close to the wild wood
things—perhaps that is what makes you wise,”
Cécile said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m not wise, but Dian is. He will take care of
Lisle, I know he will.” Marie Josephine smiled
confidently in the dark as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>She lay awake beside Cécile for a long time, Great-aunt
Hortense’s tapestry covering them both. Dian
was on his way through the wind-swept night.
Cécile, too, was awake. She was thinking of Lisle in
his blue velvet and diamonds and his jeweled sword,
of the minuet which they had danced together at the
bal masqué on that last strange, happy evening.
Dian was on his way to help; for that she was thankful.
Had she known of Humphrey Trail, in the
dingy Paris alley room, she would have been more
thankful still. Had she known of some of the plans
in the mind of the friend who lay beside her in
the great four-poster bed, she would have been
astounded and alarmed!</p>

  <h2 id='ch10' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter X</span> <br /> <br />IN THE SNOWSTORM</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Dian heard the great clock on the stairs at Les
Vignes boom out the twelve strokes of midnight as
he said the few hasty words of farewell to Neville.
He saw with satisfaction that the moon was out and
that the wind was changing. He walked down the
great driveway which led through the demesne. It
was a good mile to the gates, but with his long, easy
strides he covered the ground with amazing quickness.
At the left was the dark outline of the wood
and behind lay the wide terraces, grey and bare this
late November night.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian turned to his left at the far end of the driveway
and entered a narrow path bordered on each
side by slim poplar trees, then he climbed through
a narrow opening in a low hedge and found himself
on the highroad. He walked quickly along until
he came to the row of straggling huts to which Jean
had brought the loaves of bread on the August night
when he had tried to keep his cousin Grigge from
taking one whole loaf for himself.</p>

<p class='c018'>He knocked softly on the door of one of the huts
and waited, listening. After a moment he heard a
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'>125</a></span>
sound from within and then the door opened slightly
and a gaunt, thin face showed itself. It was the face
of Grigge, and when he saw the shepherd standing
there, he came outside, closing the door softly behind
him. He had on the same old, shabby work clothes
that he had worn all day, having lain down for the
night on his heap of straw without removing them,
glad of the little warmth they afforded him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Dian!” he exclaimed softly. “Dian! Where are
you going?”</p>

<p class='c018'>The shepherd put his sack on the ground and,
feeling in the inside pocket of his cloak, brought out
a goatskin purse and handed it to the boy, who took
it wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am going on something of a journey, Grigge,
and I am leaving my sheep in your care. I am trusting
them to you and I know that in spite of your
wild ways, lad, you will keep them faithfully for me.
Let them pasture until the snow comes and then be
on guard for the wolves. Here is a bit of money,
only a bit. Mother Barbette will give you bread
when she has it to give, but there will not be overmuch
for her and Jean. Farmer Lessoir will sell
you flour, such as it is. You must see to it that
your mother and the young children have their
share.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian put his hand kindly on Grigge’s shoulder,
and he saw that the color had come into the boy’s
cheeks at his words. Grigge caught hold of the edge
of the shepherd’s cloak and looked up at him imploringly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'>126</a></span>
for it seemed as though he could not bear to
say good-by to the one person in all the world whom
he loved and trusted.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh, do not go away and leave me, Dian. It is
awful to think of the winter’s coming. What shall
I do without you, Dian! No one will have aught
to do with me but you.” Grigge turned up the
frayed collar of his poor jacket as he spoke, for the
chill air swirled about him unmercifully.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are to be a man while I am away. Try to
be brave and to add a little comfort to the lives of
your poor mother and your brothers and sisters. Go
to your aunt for counsel. She is a good woman and
means well by you all.” Dian lifted his sack as he
spoke and threw it over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m not welcome there. I’ll have naught to do
with them,” Grigge answered sullenly, but realizing
that his friend was about to depart he caught his
cloak again. “I’ll do well by the sheep, and I’ll try
to think of the others when the hunger is tearing at
my heart. Will you not tell me where you are going
and why you leave this way in the stillness of the
night?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian shook his head. “That I cannot do, Grigge,
but if the good God will it, I shall come back again.
Remember all I have said and guard my sheep well,
for they are dear indeed to me. Hold your courage
through the winter. Who knows what good may
come by spring!” He touched the boy’s shoulder in
farewell and was off down the wide road.</p>
<div id='illus11' class='figcenter'>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'>127</a></span>
Grigge gazed after him, his hands clasped together,
a sob catching his throat. It seemed as
though all that he knew of kindliness and comradeship
was going farther and farther from him down
the wind-swept road. He had never known anything
in his life but discomfort. He had always been
hungry and in winter he had always been cold. He
was rough and selfish and sullen and he knew it and
most of the time did not care. But as he stood there
that night by the low door of his wretched home,
Grigge determined to be different! He went inside,
and the wind slammed the door behind him before
he could catch it. The noise awoke his little sister
Letta, who whined, “It is cold; it is cold.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are no colder than the rest of us,” Grigge
answered roughly, but, after hesitating a moment,
he put the piece of shawl over her and then tumbled
down on to his mound of straw by the door.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian hardly heeded the weather as he quickly
covered the ground. His thoughts were with the
lad he had left and the sad lot of the people who
lived at the very gates of a great house. He felt
sad at heart, but said to himself, as he had often
done before, “There is no use in your grieving for
them, for that will not help them, and to help them
is your dearest wish.” Grigge was only one of
thousands of young lads who were made old and
bitter by lack of food and the injustice that bound
their lives. Dian knew little of the great conflict
that was raging in Paris or of the armies massing
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'>128</a></span>
throughout the land. He knew that the people, who
for centuries had been overtaxed and overburdened
by the arrogance and indifference of the nobility,
had at last risen in revolt, but he did not know that
they were being governed by bad, unscrupulous men
and that there was no longer either law or order or
justice in Paris or in other parts of France. He had
thought that it was right for him to go to Paris,
having had a feeling, for many days past, that the
young Comte Lisle, whom he loved, was in danger.
So he had made his simple preparations, telling only
Neville, whom he knew to be faithful, where he was
going.</p>
<hr class='c022' />
<p class='c018'>The evening on which Dian told the children, in
Mother Barbette’s cottage, about the young page in
blue and silver was a wintry one in Paris. The
snow had begun to fall, slanting mistlike through
dreary alleyways. Although it was only a slight
scurry and melted almost as soon as it touched the
ground, it covered, for a little while, much of the
soot and grime, making a fairy tracery about the
roofs of the old houses. The sleet blew in a rakish,
zigzag way across the alley where Vivi lived and
far down the dim street beyond it. Curving northward,
it swirled past close-shut shop windows and
gaunt, noisy tenements, until it reached the great
square in the middle of which stood the guillotine!</p>

<p class='c018'>Then, in a sort of frenzy, it rioted down a wide
avenue, spending itself at last against the windows
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'>129</a></span>
of a house, close shut behind iron gates, in a quiet
corner of Paris.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle Saint Frère and Rosanne de Soigné were
spending the evening in the great drawing-room in
front of the fire. Rosanne knelt by the dying flames,
peering at some nuts which she was roasting in a
bed of coals. Her fair hair fell about her shoulders,
and she had on the same white frock which she had
worn on the night that she and Marie Josephine
hid in the balcony. She shivered in spite of the fact
that she wore a little velvet jacket over her frock.</p>

<p class='c018'>“One of them is almost ready to pop. That’s
yours. Wouldn’t it be a jolly thing if we could roast
one for Marie Josephine?” As she spoke Rosanne
leaned forward and picked out the nut with a pair
of long bronze tongs and laid it on the iron fender
to cool. She had stayed with Lisle and his mother
ever since her mother had gone to nurse her father.
Events had crowded thick and fast after the departure
of the others for Pigeon Valley. Madame de
Soigné had had just time to get away before the
gates were closely guarded, and her departure had
been made possible only because of an excellent disguise.
There had been no word from her, and Lisle
and his mother did what they could to keep Rosanne
from feeling the anxiety which they themselves
experienced. She never left the house and they told
her nothing of what happened in the city. She was
used to believing what she was told, but she thought
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'>130</a></span>
a great deal about it all, and she was more troubled
than they knew.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Do you think we shall be going to Pigeon Valley
soon, Lisle?” she asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle shook his head, eating the nut gingerly, for
it was still hot. He and Rosanne had not known
each other very well in the old days, but they had
become fairly well acquainted in the three months
that they had been together. Lisle did not find
Rosanne half as interesting as the little sister whom
he missed so much, but he liked her, and he had a
protecting feeling for her. She was his responsibility,
just as his mother was, and he wanted to do
his best for both of them. This was what made
things so hard for him, having to be careful for
their sakes. What adventures he could have if he
were alone!</p>

<p class='c018'>The days had been dull enough, in spite of all the
happenings in the city, and time dragged heavily.
They had had no word from Neville since he had
left for Pigeon Valley, and the longing to hear from,
the others at Les Vignes seemed sometimes more
than they could bear, but each hid his emotion from
the other. They had been taught to do this always,
and now their training was making it easier for
them to seem cheerful.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Do you think we can go to Pigeon Valley in the
spring, Lisle? Please answer me,” Rosanne persisted.
When Lisle still did not reply, she went on,
trying to hide the tremble in her voice: “It is just
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'>131</a></span>
as Marie Josephine said. You think that you are
so very grown-up. You will not tell me of all you
fear. I know that we are in great trouble. I’ve
thought more about it since yesterday morning when
Madame Saint Frère went to your Great-aunt Hortense,
who is so very ill. There were tears in your
mother’s eyes. I saw them. She is only to be away
for a few days, and yet she did not like to leave us.
Tell me, Lisle, please tell me all about it. I know
it is a revolution and that I may not go out on the
street to walk or ride and that the servants have
left us and dear maman has not sent me any word
since she went to papa. Tell me, Lisle, is it all so
dreadful?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanne came and stood looking up at Lisle, her
brown eyes eagerly watching his blue ones as he
answered her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s a bad time,” he said slowly. “It can’t last
much longer. Yes, it is a revolution and there is
danger for some people, but we are safe enough.
There is no reason why we should fear.” Lisle was
glad that Rosanne had spoken. It made them seem
more like comrades and he found that it was a relief
to talk over the situation. He saw that she was
missing his mother and he felt vaguely that he must
try to divert her. He, too, missed his mother, but
of course he would not admit it even to himself.
The comtesse had shown a softer side than any he
had ever seen before during the past months that
they had been alone. The three had sat for long
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'>132</a></span>
hours by the fire and she had told of the gay, careless
times when she had been a girl, when there had
been nothing but gay balls and gilded sedan chairs,
laughter and satins to make up her days. Now all
her friends were gone, many being imprisoned in
the Abbaye or other prisons of Paris, some having
escaped to England, some to different parts of
France, all because they and their ancestors had
oppressed the people.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanne was right when she said that Lisle’s
mother had not wanted to leave them even for a
few days. Great-aunt Hortense was ill and she had
sent her servant with a note begging her great-niece
to come to her bedside. She lived only a few
squares away.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Don’t worry, mother, we shall do quite well,
Rosanne and I. Henri will look after us as to food,
and you’ll find us roasting nuts by the fire when you
come back. I shall take good care of Rosanne,”
Lisle had assured his mother.</p>

<p class='c018'>The comtesse had put both her slender hands on
his shoulders as she answered him. “And of yourself,
my son, my only son, my beloved,” she had
said. Lisle and Rosanne had thought often, since
she left, of her emotion.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Teach me the gavotte steps again, Lisle. I shall
soon be able to dance quite well.” Rosanne held
out her hand as she spoke. “I can hum the melody
again like this. Let us see if we can do it all the
way through!”</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_133' id='Page_133'>133</a></span>
Lisle thought it a rather silly thing to do, but he
was uneasy about Rosanne’s missing his mother,
and he felt that it was his duty to keep her cheerful.
He found that he enjoyed the dance, for he directed
his companion in the different measures and he liked
telling people how to do things.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You bow so beautifully, Lisle. You are just like
the cavaliers on Monsieur Watteau’s fans,” Rosanne
exclaimed admiringly, as they reached the end of a
measure.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You will soon do very well if you will keep your
mind on it,” Lisle answered as they hummed the
bewitching melody of the last measure and took
their positions to begin.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanne colored with pleasure. She would never
have dreamed six months before that she would be
dancing with Lisle Saint Frère. She thought of the
August night when she and Marie Josephine had
watched him from the balcony as he danced with
her cousin Cécile. What would Lisle think if he
knew what a very naughty thing they had done?
Sometime it would be fun to tell him!</p>

<p class='c018'>As he danced, Lisle thought of something else his
mother had said: “I would have so little fear if I
were leaving you with Neville. We can trust him
always, but we do not know, even though he has
seemed faithful, whether or not we can always trust
Henri.” Lisle had said nothing then to his mother.
Much as he would have liked to have reassured her,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_134' id='Page_134'>134</a></span>
he did not trust Henri and never could pretend that
he did.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was yet another thing that Lisle was thinking
about. It made him say to himself sternly:
“You should be ashamed to let yourself fancy such
things. It is not fit that one who soon will go out
to fight for the king and queen should have silly
fancies.” This is what Lisle called his fancy. He
had gone several times to the bakery where he had
seen Humphrey Trail, and twice of late he thought
that on his return he was being followed! He liked
going to the bakery. He would sit at one of the
glass tables enjoying his eau sucré and a méringue
and watching the well-to-do merchants’ wives, who
for the time being had nothing to fear, come and go.
No one had seemed to notice him particularly. The
bakery woman had looked at him a little curiously
as she did up her crisp cakes in neat boxes. He
always wore the shabby old groom’s suit and he
never spoke, except to give his order and to buy the
cakes for Rosanne.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle had thought often of Humphrey Trail since
the night that the farmer had given him the Saint
Antoine address. The man had meant well. Of that
Lisle was sure. There was comfort also in the
thought that he could find Humphrey if he should
need him. Nevertheless, he had not heeded Humphrey’s
warning. He had continued to go to the
bakery. It had been one of his few pleasures during
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_135' id='Page_135'>135</a></span>
those strange weeks so suddenly different from anything
he had ever known. Never before had he
eaten in a cake shop or bought things for himself.
Everything was changing. Six months more and
there would be no shop. The shoppers themselves
would be hiding for their lives.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Henri will be back soon with the meat, and then
let us have supper in here by the fire,” suggested
Rosanne as they stopped to rest from their dancing.</p>

<p class='c018'>The fire had died down, and Lisle saw that there
was no wood left in the wood box of hammered
silver on the stone hearth. It was very cold and
he noticed, now that they had ceased dancing, that
Rosanne was shivering. Where was Henri? Why
was he not taking care of them?</p>

<p class='c018'>“I shall go out into the halls and call for Henri,
and if I do not find him, I shall go to the cellars for
some wood. Stay here by the little bit of fire that
is left. I shall only be gone a few minutes,” Lisle
said to Rosanne, and leaving her he went out into
the great marble hall. He went over to the entrance
door and, opening it, looked out at the fast
falling snow. As he did so, he thought he saw
something dark in the shadow of one of the lower
doors, but when he peered again through the darkness
and the sleet, there was nothing.</p>

<p class='c018'>He closed the door and walked down the hall.
He could hear Rosanne singing to herself in the
drawing-room:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_136' id='Page_136'>136</a></span>
“La petite Jeannette avait un poupée mignonne,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Tra la la la, Tra la la la,</div>
      <div class='line'>Elle chantait pour elle une joli chanson,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>Tra la la la, Tra la la la.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>He called “Henri,” but there was no reply, and
so he walked on down the hall, through a long corridor
as Marie Josephine had done when she had
gone to the secret cellar. He turned a corner, went
down another corridor, opened a door, and descended
a steep flight of stairs. He knew that they
must have wood to last them until Henri should
come in with their supper. He saw that the small
door at the end of the cellar that led to the basement
was open, a blast of cold wind drifting in. He
stooped and picked up as much wood as he could
carry. Then he stood up, holding the sticks against
the dark velvet of his tunic. At that moment some
one caught him firmly about the waist. The wood
fell with a thump to the stone floor as his arms were
tied quickly and skillfully behind him. He was
lifted across some one’s shoulders, and a moment
later felt the rush of cold wind in his face. Then
his captor began to run with him, swiftly, through
the fast falling snow!</p>

  <h2 id='ch11' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter XI</span> <br /> <br />“THA MUST NOT CRY OUT, LASS”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Humphrey Trail called himself all sorts of
names as he stood in the shadow near the side entrance
to the Saint Frère house that night. The
sleet was changing into snow which gave no evidence
of abating. Humphrey tied his scarf closer about
his throat and shifted from one fat leg to the other.
What a goose he was to come every evening and
stand in the shadow of such a gloomy, proud-looking
house just because he was interested in being of
service to the proud boy who lived within it, and
who, perhaps, did not care a ha’penny whether he
stood there in the sleet and wind or not!</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a fortnight since Humphrey had seen Lisle
in the bakery shop and had given him the Saint
Antoine address. He had not seen him since and
he could only comfort himself with the thought that
the boy knew where to find him. It was hard for
Humphrey, as he knew so little of all that was going
on and did not dare to ask questions of any one.
Once he had seen the servant Henri coming out of
the bakery shop with a package, but he had felt
it wiser not to speak with him. Lisle had said that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_138' id='Page_138'>138</a></span>
they did not know whether or not they could trust
Henri. Humphrey’s heart warmed as he remembered
how the lad had confided in him that night
outside the bakery shop. It comforted him as he
stood there in the storm. He had changed his position
so that instead of facing the side of the house,
he faced the front. It was not wise as a rule to do
this, or so he had felt, because the position was too
public and open, even in the darkness, but to-night
the blizzardy snow made it safe enough.</p>

<p class='c018'>Poor Humphrey, how his heart thumped when
suddenly voices caught his ear! He had no time
to be alarmed for himself or to do more than stand
close to the wall when these words reached him:
“The door by the basement steps.” Then followed
a sentence or two which Humphrey could not understand.
Then he heard the words, “The girl!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Two figures made their way down the side street,
away from the house. Humphrey watched them
until they were out of sight. Then, looking back
at the great mansion, he saw that the entrance door
was being opened by some one who seemed to find
the process difficult, and the next moment a little
girl peered out into the storm. She glanced up and
down the street, trying, evidently in vain, to distinguish
something besides the swirling snow. Then
she went inside, and the heavy door closed behind
her.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey at all times found it difficult to think
quickly, but he knew that he must do so this one
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_139' id='Page_139'>139</a></span>
time. He could only surmise, from the few words
which he had overheard, that Lisle had been seen
in the cellar, or was to be decoyed there. The incident
of the little girl’s coming to the door, as though
in search of some one, convinced him that she was
looking for Lisle. He thought he had recognized
Henri in one of the men who had passed by him,
but he was not sure. He wondered why they had
gone away from the house, instead of entering it.
He was thankful that they had not done so, but
the fact was borne in upon him that Lisle had been
abducted either by the men whom he had seen or
by their accomplices. He felt fairly sure that they
would return for Rosanne and, as he walked rapidly
around the side of the house, he tried to think what
it was best to do.</p>

<p class='c018'>He found to his relief that the cellar door was
open, and he slipped inside and made his way to
the staircase, stumbling over the wood that Lisle
had dropped. He climbed the stairs cautiously and
passed quickly down the long corridors, pausing
when he came to the great entrance hall. A door
at one side stood open, and he could see a spacious,
candle-lit room beyond. It was the salon, and as
he entered it he saw the little girl standing by the
fireplace. As he started to cross the room, he spoke
so as not to startle her too much.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tha has nought to fear, little lady. 'Tis Humphrey
Trail, and Monsieur Lisle has spoken of tha
to me!” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_140' id='Page_140'>140</a></span>
It was wise of Humphrey to speak so to Rosanne,
for, instead of fear, she felt relief at once, and ran
across the room to meet him, saying eagerly:
“Where is Lisle? Yes, he spoke of you last night.
He said he trusted you out of all Paris. He went
to the cellar for wood quite awhile ago. He said
to stay here, and I did for such a long time. Then
I went to the hall and called him. He did not come,
so I opened the front door and looked out. Where
is Lisle, Humphrey Trail?” Rosanne’s voice broke
as she put this question to the farmer, and she had
to try very hard not to cry.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey beamed upon her, and there was something
so reassuring in his smile that Rosanne smiled,
too, through her tears. “Tha’ll be a brave lass for
his sake and the sake of those tha hold dear. I’ll
give my life to find tha lad, but now tha must come
with me as quick as ever tha can. Tha must trust
Humphrey Trail. If th’art not a brave girl, I
canna help tha!”</p>

<p class='c018'>While he was speaking Humphrey had gathered
up a heavy, velvet drapery which lay across the
inlaid mother-of-pearl table near the fireplace, and
before Rosanne could think he had wrapped it
around her. “The cold is bitter. I’ll hold tha
close,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>He lifted Rosanne in his arms and glanced back
at the shadowy doorway. She put both her arms
around him and looked up at him, her bewildered
brown eyes shining bravely.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_141' id='Page_141'>141</a></span>
“I’m not afraid, Humphrey Trail, and I do trust
you. You’ll take me to Lisle, won’t you? You’ll
promise to find Lisle for me!” she said. He nodded
and whispered:</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll try!”</p>

<p class='c018'>He moved cautiously across the room and when
he reached the hall he paused, putting up his hand
to warn Rosanne not to speak. He thought that he
had heard a sound. As he stood there, holding
Rosanne closely wrapped in the blue velvet table
cover, he saw the front door open slowly, and he
knew that those who had taken Lisle away had
come back for Rosanne. He knew, too, that a great
deal depended on her, and he spoke quietly in her
ear.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tha has nought to fear. I know well how to
take tha away but tha must not cry out, lass, not
for a’ the world!” Rosanne nodded her head for
answer, and Humphrey crept with her along the
hall, keeping in the shadow until he came to the
turn which took them down the long corridor. He
began to run when he had turned the corner, and
he did not stop until he reached the top of the cellar
stairs. He knew that the men would find out at
once that Rosanne was not in the salon and would
begin to hunt for her. They might think that she
had gone to the cellar to look for Lisle, knowing
that he had gone there for wood, and they would
follow. He was right.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was necessary to take the steep stairs carefully,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_142' id='Page_142'>142</a></span>
for it was very dark, and there were deep, worn
places, like holes, in the stone steps. He nearly fell
once, and had to stop to steady himself for a moment
and to get his breath before he could go on.
When he reached the bottom of the stairs, he listened
intently but heard no sound except the scurry
of rats in the wall near them; so, lifting Rosanne to
his shoulder and wrapping the table cover more
closely about her, he went swiftly across the cellar
and through the half-open door, out into the winter
night.</p>

<p class='c018'>He kept well in the shadow of the great house
until he came to the side street, and then he started
to run. As we know, he was short and fat, and
Rosanne was not a very light weight. He kept up
a sort of jogging trot, and, finally, feeling sure now
that no one was pursuing them, he began to walk.
The snow was so dense that he had little fear of
being noticed by passers-by, and every now and then
he stopped to rest. Once when he stopped Rosanne’s
voice reached him from under the velvet
mantle.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I can walk quite well in spite of the storm,
Humphrey Trail,” she said, but he answered:</p>

<p class='c018'>“T’is wiser this way, lass. Th’art indeed a
brave enough lass.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey’s heart was sorely troubled. There
was only one place that he could take Rosanne, and
that was to his lodgings in the alley! He felt very
helpless as they came into the rue Saint Antoine.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_143' id='Page_143'>143</a></span>
The street seemed dreary and dingy, even through
the lovely falling snow. He had come to Paris for
the first holiday in all his work-a-day farmer’s life
and one after another adventures had come to him,
and with them the need to think and plan.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was no time just then to think or plan, at
least not until they were safe indoors. Humphrey,
in spite of the storm, turned the right number of
corners and reached the alley in safety. Once inside
the door of his poor abode he placed Rosanne
gently on her feet.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Listen, little lady. This is but a poor place I
bring tha to, poor indeed and cold, but it is safe and
if tha can be brave and bear with it, tha will be
helping me to find Master Lisle.” Humphrey spoke
very earnestly, and Rosanne, although she could
not see his face in the darkness of the chill hall,
knew that he was waiting anxiously for her answer.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I shall try to be brave so that you can find Lisle,
Humphrey Trail,” she answered, and, putting her
hand in his broad hard one, mounted the rickety
staircase with him.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey opened the door on the first landing
and called “Vivi.” A voice answered eagerly:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, yes!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey came into the room with Rosanne’s
hand in his. He closed the door and walked with
Rosanne over to the window where Vivi was standing
with Minuit in her arms. The two girls stared
at each other. Vivi looked the longest, but it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_144' id='Page_144'>144</a></span>
not because she was any more surprised than Rosanne;
it was only because Rosanne had been taught
that it was not right to show one’s surprise too
much, or to stare too openly at any one.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Who is that?” Vivi asked, pointing at Rosanne
over the dark curve of Minuit’s lean body.</p>

<p class='c018'>Before he could answer Rosanne looked up at
Humphrey and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c018'>“She’s a little like Marie Josephine! It’s odd,
but she is!”</p>

<p class='c018'>When Rosanne said this Humphrey felt a sudden
great relief. Little Vivi would help him. He had
not thought of that before. The two girls would
help each other, each in her own way, lonely Vivi
and lonely Rosanne, and in his big heart Humphrey
vowed that he would take care of both of them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“This is a new friend for you and Minuit, Vivi,”
he answered. “She is cold and tired and she is
lonely, too. Sit close by her here on the cot while
I make up the fire. You should not have let it go
out for I left you plenty of wood!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Vivi and Rosanne sat down on the cot, glancing
shyly at each other. Minuit sat on Vivi’s knee and
looked distrustfully at Rosanne, who stroked his
bony back timidly.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey went over to the rude fireplace, and
after some puffing of his fat cheeks, and shoving of
paper here and there, started a good blaze. When
the wood was burning nicely he put a very small
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_145' id='Page_145'>145</a></span>
shovelful of coal on top of it. Then he came back
and spoke to the two children on the cot.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Listen well to what I say, please, tha in particular,
Miss Rosanne, as, perhaps, I’d best be calling
tha. Vivi does not understand much that I
say. I am going abroad now for food. I may be
back within a half hour. Th’art to bolt the door
after me when I go, and th’art not to let any one in
but me. Tha will know me because I’ll say 'Buns’
very loud outside the door. Tell Vivi what I have
said to thee. Tell her she must na open to any
one!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanne promised. “I’ll not let any one in who
does not say 'Buns,’” she assured him, and again, to
his relief, he saw that she was smiling. He went
out and waited on the top stair until he heard the
bolt turn.</p>

<p class='c018'>Because of the unusual and exciting turn of
events, Humphrey for once had not brought food
to Vivi. He would buy the food now and go back
with it to the girls. Then he would go up to his
own room and think. He must have an hour to
think, to consider, to plan. Rosanne de Soigné
would be safe enough that night with Vivi, and
they both would be warm and fed. He thought
Rosanne might be safe there for some time. The
next all important problem was Lisle Saint Frère,
the boy with the proud face, who had told him that
he trusted him out of all Paris! To find out who
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_146' id='Page_146'>146</a></span>
were his captors, to find where they had hidden
him, to rescue him, and to bring him to safety—these
were the things above all others that he must
do. He would think out what was the best thing
to do during the snowy night, while the rats scudded
back and forth in the walls of the dark alley and
the two girls slept cuddled close together in the
room below, covered with the blue velvet table
cover and the piece of torn sacking.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanne would wake in the morning to find herself
in the cold gloom of a poor tenement, but that
night she had been too dazed and tired to take
stock of her surroundings. She had eaten the bread
which Humphrey had brought, and with it a piece
of cheese. She had sat close to the fire with Vivi,
and she had seen Vivi looking at her with the big,
astonished black eyes that somehow were like Marie
Josephine’s. The whole event of the evening had
taken place so suddenly and unexpectedly. She and
Lisle had been cosily roasting chestnuts by the fire
one moment, and the next moment, so it seemed,
he was gone, and Humphrey Trail had come and
carried her off! It all seemed like a dream to her
that evening, and she felt as though she would
wake up at any moment. The dirty, dark room
and the quiet, staring little girl did not seem real.
But she liked Vivi and after the two girls had
smiled at each other, they felt somehow like friends.
Rosanne was very glad indeed that Vivi was there.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_147' id='Page_147'>147</a></span>
She put her arm around Vivi, who sleepily did
the same. Then she fell asleep and dreamt that
she was running along the south terrace at Les
Vignes with Marie Josephine and that the lilies
were in bloom all along the way.</p>

  <h2 id='ch12' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter XII</span> <br /> <br />DIAN MAKES A FRIEND</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Dian had reached the gates of Paris and passed
through. Though he did not in any way realize it,
it was a remarkable thing that he had done. There
had been a slight scrimmage among a flock of sheep
at the west barrier when he came up to it, and much
shouting and bad language had ensued. The guards
at the gates were stupid, bad-tempered men, and
they berated the market farmers loudly. Dian had
called out to the flock in the tones so well known by
his own sheep at home in Pigeon Valley. He knew
well that the sheep would listen to him, and in an
instant it seemed as though all the wild disorder
among them had never been. They passed through
the gates, and Dian went with them. There was
no one in the motley crowd who did not think that
he was their shepherd except the men who owned
them, and they were glad enough to be out of the
brawl! It had been easy enough to get into Paris,
and Dian, with his simple faith, felt that when the
right time came it would be easy to get out again.</p>

<p class='c018'>His journey had not been difficult for he was used
to every kind of weather and he loved the wind and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_149' id='Page_149'>149</a></span>
the snow. He rested whenever he was tired, and he
never minded sleeping in the corner of a barn, with
his warm cloak wrapped snugly about him. He had
brought food in his wallet, and whenever he had
thought it wise, he had asked for a glass of warm
milk. He walked with long strides, knowing well
how to save himself unnecessary fatigue, and he
thought not at all about his own welfare. He had
never been in a city before in all his life, and had
never seen large numbers of people together, and
as he stood quietly on a street corner watching the
wild tide of life that swept past him, he wondered
greatly.</p>

<p class='c018'>He had a hard task before him. He was thinking
how best to perform it, as he stood in the
shadow of a gabled shop door on this dark, brooding
day. It was less than a week since Lisle had
been carried away from his home and Humphrey
Trail had brought Rosanne to be a friend to Vivi.
To find Lisle’s home was Dian’s task, and he wanted
to do it without asking questions of any one. He
took out a faded, leather wallet from an inner
pocket of the smock which he wore under his cloak.
Standing so that the light fell upon the wallet, he
took from it a long folded piece of thin paper, which
he opened and examined. It was the plan of a
street and a house. He stood for a long time there
in the shadow looking at it closely. It was traced
in black ink delicately but distinctly. After he had
looked at it for some time, he folded it up and put
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_150' id='Page_150'>150</a></span>
it back in the wallet, and then put the wallet in
the inner pocket of his smock again.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some one bumped against him in passing. It was
a farmer’s lad with a sack of potatoes over his
shoulder. They were close to the gates and the
market carts were drawn up in rows near by, looking
ghostly in the cold morning fog. The boy had
an honest face, and Dian was moved to speak to
him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is a bleak winter day,” he volunteered, and
the boy answered snappily:</p>

<p class='c018'>“There’s no sense in bringing in produce these
mornings. Wait till spring, I tell the master. Then
there will be lettuces and cucumbers, something
worth while; though there won’t be so many to
enjoy them as last spring, I’m thinking.” The boy
spoke significantly, meaning that many of the rich
aristocrats, who had enjoyed the market dainties,
were now in prison or had already been executed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Have you served many of the great houses with
your master’s produce?” Dian asked the boy.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Bless you, of a surety! There are none of the
big houses that I do not know. All of Saint Germain
has tasted our lettuces and our young carrots.
But that’s all passed now; their day is gone. You
look as though you knew a farm well yourself, and
as though you did not feel too well acquainted with
the city.” He eyed Dian frankly, but not impudently,
as he spoke.</p>
<div id='illus12' class='figcenter'>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_151' id='Page_151'>151</a></span>
“Yes, I am new to the city and I confess that I
would be glad of company. Would you not like
to stroll about for a while? This does not seem to
be a cheerful part of town. Let us take a look elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian had the rare gift of reading faces. He had
felt, when he first saw the farmer’s boy, that he
was to be trusted and that he was merry and honest
of heart. He was very well content when the boy
replied that he would like to go about for a while,
and he did not have to report to his master until
late afternoon. The two started off together, keeping
along the quieter streets, and walking rapidly
until they came to the great square facing the one-time
Tuileries palace.</p>

<p class='c018'>As they stood there in the great square, they
could see the black, sinister guillotine in the distance.
Dian shut his eyes and stood for a few moments
with his head bowed over his clasped hands. He
was giving thanks for the long, warm summer days,
the comfort of the stars at night, and the confidence
of his sheep as he led them home at sundown. The
noise of the city was all about him. Wild voices
were singing the “Ça Ira,” the song of the revolution,
rough, ragged groups of men and women
in scarlet caps jostled past him. There were
sounds of pounding and hammering everywhere,
and he could hear the clanging of anvils from near-by
forges. All over the city, these forges had sprung
up over night, to make weapons for the people.</p>

<p class='c018'>They walked the great length of the square and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_152' id='Page_152'>152</a></span>
except for a curious glance or so at Dian because
of his red locks and his great stature, no one noticed
them at all. They kept in the midst of the crowd
going up the rue Saint Honoré. The tri-color
ribbons and the gay red caps of the half-starved
crowds made splashes of brilliance through the
greyness. The farm boy touched Dian’s arm.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Listen,” he said and his voice sank almost to a
whisper. “Listen! I hear the roar of the tumbrils.
They are coming this way. They almost always
do. I have seen them before.” He caught Dian’s
arm as he spoke, and Dian could feel him trembling.</p>

<p class='c018'>The shepherd laid his hand on the lad’s arm.
“Let us come away from all this. I do not want
to see them. I cannot help them by seeing them.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Do you want to help them?” the boy asked.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I want to help everyone,” Dian answered.</p>

<p class='c018'>They walked down a side street, away from the
rue Saint Honoré, but the roar of the tumbrils followed
them for a long time. Dian was sad at
heart. He knew too well that for long centuries
the people of France had been kept down and
abused and embittered by the tyranny and injustice
of the nobles, but he knew also that every day
many innocent people were going to their death in
the great square, that the revolution no longer had
any dignity, no longer was a striving for justice and
equal rights for all. It had grown to be a nightmare
of wild, undisciplined horror. Dian was in
earnest when he said that he wanted to help everyone—Grigge
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_153' id='Page_153'>153</a></span>
as well as Lisle. He wanted it more
than anything else in all the world.</p>

<p class='c018'>As they walked, the boy told Dian that his name
was Raoul, and that he came into the city once a
week with his master. He said that they always
stayed over night, at lodgings above a seed shop
near the west barrier, and returned to the country
the following day. They walked on until they came
in sight of the Bois, a dark blur against the winter
sky. The Bois is a wood in the heart of Paris. It
had the same charm and mystery about it then that
it has to-day. Dian stood looking at it, thinking
of what Neville had told him of the gay coaching
parties and promenades and daily drives in their
gilded coaches of the Saint Frères and other families
of the nobility. They were all gone now, these
same families, hiding for their lives.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian knew the Saint Frère house as soon as he
saw it, not so much by the plan he had, which would
help him more in finding his way about inside, as by
an engraving which he had seen in the study of the
old Comte Saint Frère at Les Vignes. It was not
difficult to distinguish it from the other great houses
near it. There was something medieval and different
about it. Indeed, there was no house in all
of Paris quite so old.</p>

<p class='c018'>He did not speak of the house to Raoul, as they
passed by it. They had a modest meal of coffee and
bread for a few sous at a stand near the farmer
boy’s lodgings. Then Dian went with him as far
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_154' id='Page_154'>154</a></span>
as the seed shop and there they bid each other
good-by. Raoul said that he was glad to have met
him, for he was timid about going alone in the
streets while the city was in such a turmoil, and it
was good to have the company of one who, like
himself, knew the country and farm ways. Dian
answered that he would know how to find him at
his lodgings. The boy assured him that he could
always be found there on Thursdays, unless the
weather was so bad that his master gave up coming
into Paris.</p>

<p class='c018'>As he walked away from the seed shop, Dian
felt deeply grateful that he had become acquainted
with the farmer’s boy, Raoul. He would be coming
and going out of Paris every week. That in
itself was something to remember. It was growing
dark, and the shepherd walked slowly back by the
way which he had taken earlier in the day with
Raoul, past the Bois to the Saint Frère house. A
small part of his task had already been accomplished.
He had found the Saint Frère house.
The next thing was to enter it. This would be an
easy enough task if the comtesse were at home,
but something told Dian that she was not.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was so dark by the time he reached its gates
that he could see the house only vaguely. A fine
sleet was falling, and there was something sad about
the aspect of the whole place. Dian walked up the
marble steps to the great iron door and pulled the
silken cord. He heard a loud clang echoing through
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_155' id='Page_155'>155</a></span>
the great house, but, although he waited for a long
time, no one opened the door. He went around to
the side of the house which opened directly on to
the dark, narrow side street which Marie Josephine
had traversed with Gonfleur the night of the bal
masqué. After groping about for a while in the
dark, Dian found the door leading into the cellar.
It was half open. He went inside, stepped over
the logs of wood lying on the floor, crept up the
steep, dark stairs, and found himself facing a long
corridor.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian always remembered that walk through the
great, silent house. There was no sound anywhere
at all, and there was no sign of any human being.
The drawing-rooms, the great halls, and the wide
stairways seemed never to have known the touch of
human footsteps. In one of the smaller rooms,
on a pillow of a velvet couch, he saw some needlework
and a pair of scissors lying beside it. It looked
as though the sewing had been carelessly thrown
down, as indeed it had been when Great-aunt Hortense’s
servant had come for the comtesse.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian stood still in the center of the drawing-room
and pondered. He looked at the inlaid
mother-of-pearl table from which Humphrey had
snatched the blue velvet covering to put about
Rosanne, and at the wide hearth where Lisle and
Rosanne had toasted the nuts that night a week
ago, when so much had happened. Dian could not
know of all this, but he worked things out in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_156' id='Page_156'>156</a></span>
mind. The house had not been taken over by the
Republican soldiers. Of that he was convinced.
Neville had told him of much that was happening,
and he knew that he would have found some sign
of occupation either by the mob or official authority.</p>

<p class='c018'>He went on up to the floor above and came to
a large room which he was sure must have belonged
to the comtesse, for in it were a gilded bed with
a blue brocade coverlet, and a tall dressing table
with blue draperies and gold toilet articles. There
was a little room off this which interested Dian and
he stayed in it for some time. Dian had not wanted
to go through the house, but he knew that he must
do everything in his power to find Lisle and his
mother and the little girl who had always been
the Little Mademoiselle’s best friend. That was
why the little room off the comtesse’s big one interested
him so much. There was a sleeping couch,
and close by it a table. On the table were arranged
some books, and propped against the books was a
water-color painting of a dog. In spite of the
wobbly legs and ungainly shape, Dian realized that
it was meant to be a likeness of Flambeau. He
picked it up and read what was written on it:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Flambeau wishes to give you his best felicitations
for your birthday. Your friend, Marie
Josephine.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The date was that of a year or more before.
It evidently had been one of Rosanne’s greatest
treasures. She had brought it with her when she
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_157' id='Page_157'>157</a></span>
had had to leave her own home so suddenly for the
Saint Frère home. As Dian looked at the painting,
he felt the same sadness of heart that he had felt
when Grigge had begged him not to go away. It
was because he had such deep and tender pity for
any one in distress.</p>

<p class='c018'>He passed on to the servants’ part of the house.
Everywhere he saw evidence of careless, hasty departure.
There was one room that seemed different
from the others; it gave the air of being occupied.
Dian knew at once that it belonged to Henri, the
one servant who had stayed, and he whom Neville
did not trust. The door of the room was open, and
Dian went inside. Henri probably still lived here,
and at any moment he might return.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian went on down through the vast house, feeling
his way in the darkness, until he came to the
long corridor on the lower floor. He took a candle
from one of many in a bronze candelabra on the
hall table, and then, with his sack over his shoulder,
made his way to the top of the cellar stairs. Here
he lit his candle with flint and tinder which he had
found in a box on the drawing-room floor. Then
he climbed down, down, until he came to the dim
cellar. He knelt on the floor and pressed the little
square stone—the seventh—that was wedged in between
the other stones. The stone slid aside and,
as the space opened to receive him, he descended
slowly into the heart of the ancient house, into the
furthermost depths of its hidden fastness. Before
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_158' id='Page_158'>158</a></span>
descending, he touched the stone and it slipped back
into place. He had faith that it would open as
easily again at his touch. He had searched for no
lodging in Paris that day because he knew that he
would lodge deep underground. He was “the
other one” who knew of the hidden cellar!</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>“Jean, you must not be sulky. I have told you
before that you are a great baby. I only played
and pretended to be happy. I shall never be so
stupid again.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine and Jean were swinging on the
gates of Les Vignes, enjoying the keen rush of air
about their faces as they swung back and forth.
It was a week since Dian had left in the night and
they missed him sadly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It doesn’t matter whether we miss Dian or not,
if only he can be of comfort to maman and Lisle,”
Marie Josephine went on. “I heard the man talking
to Nannette. You know, the man who brought
the news about the king. They have killed the king
and the man said that they would kill the poor
queen. Lisle will run away and fight for the queen,
even if he is only fifteen. I know he will. Lisle,
Lisle, I want to see you so much!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are not the same since Dian left. You
will not play, and you look as though you were
thinking all the time,” said Jean, biting into a
wizened apple.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_160' id='Page_160'>160</a></span>
“I am thinking, Jean. When Neville came back
that night that we had supper on the terrace, he
brought us no good news. I have not been happy
since.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean jumped down from the gate, and held it
so that it stopped swinging back and forth. He
looked up at Marie Josephine.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What is your thought, Little Mademoiselle?
Tell me what it is; please tell little Jean!” He
looked so young as he stood there. Marie Josephine
gave her head an impatient shake, so that the
blue hood of her cape fell back on her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Your cousin Grigge is coming this way, Jean,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge came up to them along the bleak, frozen
road. He would have passed them by with a sort
of half nod to Marie Josephine and a scowl for
Jean, had not Marie Josephine called out to him:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Will you not come and speak with us, Grigge?
We have been talking of Dian the shepherd, and
we wish that we could see him.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge had never spoken with the Little Mademoiselle
before although he had seen her every
summer, and she had always given him a pleasant
greeting. He was so eager for news of Dian, that
he came up to them at once.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You have heard from him, Mademoiselle!
Tell me that you have had word!” He came close
to the gates and looked up eagerly at Marie Josephine.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_161' id='Page_161'>161</a></span>
She shook her head. “There is no news of him,
but he has only been away a week. We are sure that
he is happy, wherever he is. Nothing but good
could happen to Dian.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge clasped his hands together in his eagerness.</p>

<p class='c018'>“No, no, you are right. Nothing could happen.
He will come back,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine nodded emphatically.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Jean and I will walk with him across the
meadows at sunset, and he will have so many wonderful
things to tell us about his adventures!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge looked at her wonderingly, at the fineness
of her blue cape, the delicate contour of her face,
her carefully brushed curls, her straight black velvet
frock. He had never been close up to any one
like her before. She was so unlike anything in his
own life that she might have come from another
world. When she told him that no news had come
from Dian, his face fell. All the week he had felt
a weight of loneliness upon him. He had taken
faithful care of the sheep and he had been proud of
the task, but the one person who made life bearable
for him had gone away.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine looked at Grigge with interest.
What a pale, thin boy he was, and what big eyes
he had! She felt a lump in her throat as she looked
at him. Marie Josephine was beginning to wake up.
She was beginning to realize that there was something
in the world besides the house in Paris and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_162' id='Page_162'>162</a></span>
Les Vignes, governesses and bals masqués. She was
seeing Grigge for the first time, not just as a poor,
ragged lad living in one of the hovels at the very
gates of her home, but as some one who was unhappy
and worried and in need of comfort, as she
was herself. Feeling this way about Grigge was
so new to her that she did not know what to make
of it.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Do you miss Dian so much?” she asked him.</p>

<p class='c018'>He nodded, his face working as though he would
cry.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He has gone to help my brother. He told Jean
and me a story about a prince. It came to him
suddenly, and he told it to us. He called Lisle his
prince, and he said he felt that he was in trouble.”
Marie Josephine’s voice shook, and the tears
sprang into her eyes in spite of herself.</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge sneered in the way he so often did when
he spoke to his cousin Jean. He was hungry and
cold. The wind whistled through his tattered coat.
So that was it! Dian had gone away to help some
one who had never done anything for him, who
probably did not need him at all!</p>

<p class='c018'>“Why should he go to your brother? What has
he ever done for him? What have any of you ever
done for us? You have done nothing but starve
us! My father had to spend his nights beating
the swamps so that the frogs would not disturb your
people’s sleep!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge spoke so fast that he jumbled all his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_163' id='Page_163'>163</a></span>
words together. His eyes snapped oddly in his
gaunt face. He had not meant to burst out in that
way. The words seemed to come almost without
his knowing it. It was a bitter, dark winter. They
had nothing and, he felt sure, never would have
anything but bitter want. He felt jealous, too,
when he saw his cousin Jean. He always had been
jealous because Jean lived within the gates, and
had better food than he.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine’s eyes were full upon him. They
were filled with astonishment, but not anger. She
was too interested to be angry.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Dian maybe is risking his life! There are terrible
times in Paris. We heard from the peddler
that they have killed the king. Your brother is
not worth as much as Dian’s staff!” Grigge went
on excitedly.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean flung himself from the gate and pitched
into Grigge before either he or Marie Josephine
could think. He had been swinging back and forth
and listening, and when Grigge said that Lisle was
not worth as much as Dian’s staff, he was ready
to spring! The two boys rolled over and over on
the hard ground. Jean knew that he was getting
the worst of it, but he did not mind. He was fighting
for the Little Mademoiselle, and he gloried in
it. Let her say again that he was only a baby, and
that he would never grow up! She would see that
he could avenge her! She would see that no one
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_164' id='Page_164'>164</a></span>
could insult her brother in his presence, even if
he were only little Jean!</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine’s voice rang out sharply in the
clear, frosty air.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Stop! Do you hear me? I say you are to stop.
Do not dare to hurt little Jean, Grigge!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge had Jean upon the ground and was pounding
him with his fists.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine ran over to the two boys.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It would break Dian’s heart to see you,” she
cried. Grigge immediately left off pounding and
stood up, and after a moment Jean followed his
example. Grigge looked sullen and sheepish, but
Jean’s little face glowed. Marie Josephine had
given him a look of approval.</p>

<p class='c018'>They stood there, the three of them, in the pale
wintry sunshine. Marie Josephine looked straight
into Grigge’s eyes. She held her blue cloak about
her shoulders, her curls blew in the wind, and on
her white, earnest face was a look that had never
been there before.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I didn’t know, Grigge. I am just waking up
to—oh, so many things! You are not the only one
who has trouble now, remember that. We must all
try to help each other.” As she spoke, she turned
away toward the gates, but Grigge’s voice followed
her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m sorry, Mademoiselle,” he cried.</p>

<p class='c018'>Late the next afternoon Marie Josephine sought
Jean at the cottage. He was alone, sitting on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_165' id='Page_165'>165</a></span>
settle by the fire, and he was just finishing his early
supper of onion soup. Mother Barbette had gone
to the hovel to take some soup to Grigge’s youngest
sister, who was ailing.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine shut the door behind her and
came over and sat on the settle, well pleased to
find that Jean was alone.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is soon time for me to be dressed for our
supper, so I can only stay for a very little while.
I have been thinking some more, Jean, and I am
going to tell you what I have planned to do.” She
looked at him very earnestly as she spoke. “I think
I shall tell you—if only I can be quite, quite sure
that I can trust you. Now do not frown. You
might forget and let a word slip. Will you promise
me that you will never, never let any one know what
I am going to tell you?” She put both hands on
his shoulders as she spoke and her eyes shone with
eagerness.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean nodded vigorously. He would not mention
what he had done, not he. She had seen him pitch
into Grigge, a big boy, who was known to be a
fighter. She knew that he was not so young as
she had thought. He could keep his own counsel
too.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll never tell, never, never, never,” he assured
her.</p>

<p class='c018'>She went over to the door, opened it, and looked
out to make sure that no one was coming. A shriek
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_166' id='Page_166'>166</a></span>
from above the door made her jump, but it was
only Pince Nez the crow.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine walked over to the fire and
poked one of the logs with her little bronze shoe.
There was some snow on the shoe and it fell into
the logs with a sizzling sound.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is like this, Jean,” she said. “I’ve thought
about it so many times, lying awake at night, and
even when sitting with the others around the drawing-room
fire after our supper, while Hortense and
Le Pont worked over their tapestries and Cécile
read aloud. Oh, Jean, I was only thirteen last
week, but I feel older than any of them now. It
makes me so sad when I see Le Pont doing the
tapestry lilies on the screen that she has been working
on for four years in the summers at Les Vignes,
and remember how different it all was when she
began it.” Marie Josephine choked back a sob.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, but tell me what it is that you are thinking
about,” insisted Jean, as Pince Nez lighted suddenly
on his shoulder and gave his ear a friendly little
peck. “You are thinking of Madame your mother
and of Monsieur Lisle, is it not so?” As he said
this, he came over to the fire and stood beside her,
frowning.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I do not know whether to tell you or not——”
Marie Josephine began, but she was interrupted
by Jean’s angry words:</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are going to say again that I am a baby
and I will not bear it. Did I not fight my cousin
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_167' id='Page_167'>167</a></span>
Grigge for the sake of you all, this very day?”
Jean gulped down a sob and wiped his eyes with
the sleeve of his black smock.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine patted his shoulder reassuringly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You were splendid, a real friend. I was proud
of you. Yes, I am going to tell you. I have a plan
which I must carry out.” She sat down on the
settle, holding the sides of her cape with both hands,
and looked across at him. “When the spring comes,
Jean,” she went on, “I am going to”—her voice
sank to a whisper—“Paris.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean’s face went blank with astonishment. “You
do not mean it! Why you would never be allowed,
never in the world. They would never let you go!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Don’t be stupid, Jean. They will know nothing
about it. It is a secret.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is not safe to go! You could not do it!
You are only a little girl. It would be bad enough
for me, who am a boy.” Jean enjoyed saying this
very much and he felt suddenly the older and more
experienced of the two. He had felt so ever since
his fight with Grigge in the morning.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I tell you that I will go. You cannot understand,
for I can tell you only a little of why I am
going,” she answered, frowning at him with her
straight, black eyebrows which were so like the old
comte’s.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is not safe to go. The peddler, who told us
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_168' id='Page_168'>168</a></span>
of the king’s death, said it was not safe. He said
to go to Paris was to endanger one’s life!” protested
Jean, his eyes growing bigger and bigger
with excitement.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The peddler said many things that were not
true. Le Pont is sure that he could not have spoken
the truth. No one would hurt me. I am not
afraid,” she answered stoutly. “Maman and Lisle
are in Paris. Have you forgotten Dian’s story
about the prince in the dungeon. He has gone to
help them, and so must I.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“What could you do for them?” Jean was so
deeply interested that he spoke loudly, and Marie
Josephine held up her hand warningly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You must be silent about all this; it is to be a
great secret between us.” She shook her finger
at Pince Nez, who had perched himself on the top
of Mother Barbette’s four-poster bed. “You are
not to tell either, you naughty creature. I do not
trust you. I think you are a witch in disguise!”</p>

<p class='c018'>This seemed so funny to Jean that he fairly
doubled up with laughter, rocking back and forth
and chuckling loudly. He was so excited that it
made him laugh all the harder and his mother, who
at this moment opened the door, stood and gazed
at him in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Why, you silly cabbage, you laugh like a clown.
He is indeed a foolish feather head, is he not,
Little Mademoiselle?” Mother Barbette put her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_169' id='Page_169'>169</a></span>
arm tenderly about Marie Josephine and she hid
her face on the broad, kind shoulder.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is so dark and cold. Will summer ever come?”
she said. Mother Barbette gave a reassuring little
laugh.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Surely summer is coming, Little Mademoiselle,
and with it the sunshine”—and her voice faltered
a little as she went on—“and the dear ones who
are away!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Something in Mother Barbette’s words comforted
Marie Josephine. She gave her a hug and
said: “I love you, Mother Barbette. I must run
back now, for, as it is, I know that I shall be well
scolded by Le Pont for being out after dark.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Jean shall go with you through the wood, though
there is never any fear for any one in our woods
at Les Vignes, thank the kind God,” said Mother
Barbette fervently. She stood in the low-arched
doorway of the cottage watching the two children
as they made their way toward their favorite wood
path which led to the great house on the terrace.</p>

<p class='c018'>The two friends ran a little of the way and then
suddenly Jean stopped in the middle of the path and
caught Marie Josephine’s cloak in both his hands.
A wild rabbit scudded through the snow, popping
behind a glistening, frost-tinted bush. Jean called
after it, and then turned back to look at his friend.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Listen, Little Mademoiselle. Don’t you know
what I must do? When you go away to Paris in
the spring I must go with you.” He, too, lowered
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_170' id='Page_170'>170</a></span>
his voice to a whisper, and he looked back over
his shoulder, as though he feared that his mother
might be right behind them, listening.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine took him by the shoulders and
gave him a little shake. “You will not go. Not
for anything in the world would I let you go. Do
you think I would be such an ungrateful girl as that
to Mother Barbette? You are never to speak of
it again—never!” Marie Josephine was so excited
that she had to take a deep breath before
she could go on. “Oh, if only you could! But we
must never, never talk of it again!” Her eyes
glowed as she spoke, and there was a glad, warm
feeling in her heart. It was good to have a friend
like Jean, even though he seemed so young for
twelve and a half and knew so little of the world
beyond Les Vignes!</p>

<p class='c018'>They reached the wide sweep of terrace and she
turned to him quickly. “I must run, for I am sure
they will be angry because it is dark. Le Pont has
grown so fussy and afraid. She cries a great deal,
too. Thank you for saying you would go with me.
It can never, never be done. It would be unfair
and dishonorable of me to let you go. A Saint
Frère could not do such a thing—— But it would
have been fun!”</p>

<p class='c018'>She was off, running across the terrace like a wild
rabbit. The governess was standing at the top
of the veranda steps. Marie Josephine could see
that she was frowning.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_171' id='Page_171'>171</a></span>
“You make it so much harder for me these days,
Marie Josephine,” she said, holding her dark satin
cloak close about her. The wind swept across the
porch, making the dry, frozen lily stalks at the
side of the house crackle oddly. “I am never at
ease about you. You never seem to be in the house.
To-morrow you will stay inside all day, and you
will do extra lessons. You are disobedient and
thoughtless!” After she had spoken Madame le
Pont went into the house.</p>

<p class='c018'>Bertran did most of the talking at supper. He
tried to make Marie Josephine quarrel with him,
but she did not seem to mind his teasing as she generally
did. She despised Bertran. He was fourteen
and yet he did nothing but ride and dance.
Ah, if only he were a brave knight who could go to
Paris and help Lisle! There was instead only little
Jean. Her heart warmed toward Jean as she sat
next to Cécile in the long drawing-room after
supper. She watched Neville as he went about
lighting the candles. He was dressed in the scarlet
and white livery of the old Paris days and his white
wig was tied back with a black ribbon. She had
asked him again and again to tell her all that he
knew. He had assured her, with all honesty, that
he had left her mother and Lisle safe and well at
the Paris house, and that there was no need for
her to be alarmed. But she knew that he did not
believe that they were not in danger, and she
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_172' id='Page_172'>172</a></span>
guessed that he was thankful that Dian had gone to
them.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine put her head against Cécile’s
shoulder and looked into the fire with half-closed
eyes. Denise was singing at the old spinnet and
Bertran was trying to join in, but his voice sounded
as though any moment it would crack. It was an
old country song and there was something plaintive
and charming about it.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Le Pont thought of her only as a naughty little
girl. Dear Cécile, her heart was sad; yet she could
do nothing but work on her tapestry and pray for
her loved ones who were in peril. But she, Marie
Josephine, was going away alone to a great city,
into the heart of a revolution! She was going in
the spring!</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>“Tell me some more, please. See, I will blow
the fire and make a blaze.” Vivi spoke pleadingly,
as she picked up some pieces of a broken basket and
put them on the low fire in the tiny, rusty grate.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You tell me something, Vivi. I’ve talked and
talked, and now I want to know about you. Have
you always lived here in the alley? Let’s sit close
together to keep warm, and let’s talk.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanne drew the velvet table cover close about
them and they hitched the cot as near the fire as they
could without getting up.</p>

<p class='c018'>Vivi shook her head.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What is there for me to tell, Mademoiselle? It
is you who have done everything. I have done nothing.
I have lived with my father always, here in
the alley. Winter and summer I have lived here.
In the summer I go out and play in the streets.
There is always some fun about the gates. We
used to catch rides on the market carts, and that
was the most fun of all. Sometimes we would ride
way out into the country. But those times are over,
for now no one may go in and out of the city without
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_174' id='Page_174'>174</a></span>
a pass, and there is always shouting and fighting
around the gates.”</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a fortnight since Humphrey Trail had
brought Rosanne to Vivi. Their acquaintance had
progressed by leaps and bounds. Shut in from the
winter cold and terrors of the city, it was small
wonder that they were drawn together. The days
had been long, the only excitement being the arrival
of Humphrey with food and good cheer. But he
always had to shake his head when Rosanne asked
for news of Lisle. He did not let her see how he
himself was worried to distraction over the boy;
instead he always had a word of encouragement.
They would have a clue soon. He was probably
safe enough. Yet all the while, night and day, he
was going over in his mind the few things that he
knew about Lisle. Where was he? How to find
him? These were the grave questions always before
Humphrey Trail!</p>

<p class='c018'>This particular February night he was feeling
discouraged, and for that reason pretended to be
more than usually cheerful before the two girls. He
found them sitting on the cot close to the fire and
spoke to them merrily.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What would tha say to a bit o’ sweet cake!
Humphrey Trail will bring tha some. Tha shall
see!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Vivi smiled delightedly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“A real cake from a bakery shop; one with
cherries,” she pleaded.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_175' id='Page_175'>175</a></span>
“Bring news of Lisle, Humphrey Trail,” Rosanne
said. Her brown eyes looked very big in her small,
white face.</p>

<p class='c018'>Above all things he must see that the little girl
kept her cheer and courage. “Tha’ll be running
races with him some day in the land o’ Yorkshire,”
he said as he threw his cloak over his shoulder and
went out.</p>

<p class='c018'>He stood uncertainly for some moments on the
corner of the rue Saint Antoine in a swirl of snow.
Sounds of rough, brawling voices came down the
dark street. The snow was black with the ashes and
smoke from near-by forges where guns were being
made for the army. Humphrey stepped inside a
small café at the end of the street and, seating himself
at a rude table near the door, ordered a glass
of hot ale. He had never attempted any disguise.
He was just an honest farmer and taken for such
by any one who took the trouble to notice him. Few
would have thought him to be other than French
until they heard him speak. There were many out-of-towners
in the city at that time, market farmers,
well-to-do villagers, all eager to join in the talk and
wrangle of the day, each with his own especial plan
or grievance, all ardent Republicans.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey listened to a group who sat near him,
rough, unkempt men of the Saint Antoine district.
He had made it a practice, during the last fortnight,
of dropping in here and there and listening to the
talk going on around him. He sipped his hot ale,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_176' id='Page_176'>176</a></span>
listening intently, but his knowledge of French was
so meager that he could only catch a word here and
there.</p>

<p class='c018'>“They think they’re mighty fine, those aristos
living snugly in their grand houses in the country.
They think their fields and cattle and their hired
slaves will save them. Well, they’ll sing another
song soon. They’ll not stay long in hiding. They’ll
be hunted out, root and branch, all of them!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Loud laughter and applause greeted the end of
this harangue. After putting down the coins to pay
for his drink, Humphrey went out into the wintry
night. He had heard something which gave him
food for thought, and he felt that it would ease his
mind to walk about the city. He was restless, but
his discouragement had given place to alertness.
There was so much to do that he had not a moment
for brooding. For a week or more he had been
wondering how it was with Lisle’s family at Pigeon
Valley. The day after Lisle’s disappearance he had
gone to the Marquise du Ganne’s house. Rosanne
knew the house well, having gone there on state
occasions with Marie Josephine. She was able to
give Humphrey a fair idea of how to find it. She
told him that the coat of arms on the door was different
from that of the Saint Frères’. It was a shield
with two swords crossed in the middle. He had
found the house, but he had found, also, two soldiers
of the Republic stationed in front of it. He had
stopped and spoken to them.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_177' id='Page_177'>177</a></span>
“Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, citizen,” he had
said, and they had answered, “Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity, citizen.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“You have a chilly day for doing naught but
standing still,” he went on. They had laughed at
his attempt to speak their Paris French, and one of
them had replied:</p>

<p class='c018'>“We are watching a nest to see that the birds do
not fly away, citizen.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then he had gone on as unconcernedly as he
could. So Lisle’s mother and his Great-aunt Hortense
were prisoners, too!</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey was thinking over this occurrence of a
fortnight ago, as he walked toward the Place de la
Bastille. He had gone back twice since to a vantage
point where he could see the Du Ganne house without
being observed himself. Both times he had seen
the soldiers. He was thankful that Rosanne was
safe for the present, at least. He was slowly
trying to prepare a way of escape when the time
should come that he could get away, but he knew
that unless he could take the children, Lisle and
Rosanne, with him, he would never go. He would
not go alone.</p>

<p class='c018'>The skipper of the schooner <i>Sandlass</i>, Anastasius
Grubb, was a Yorkshire friend of his. He had
made the voyage across from England with his
crony, and he had waved him a smiling good-by
from the shore. But that was some time ago now
and Anastasius was as far away and unattainable as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_178' id='Page_178'>178</a></span>
the stars, or so it seemed to Humphrey on that raw
February night!</p>

<p class='c018'>He walked on toward the rue Saint Honoré,
drawing up the wide collar of his coat as the stinging
wind blew about him. At last he turned in at
the gilded door of the bakery at 126 rue Saint
Honoré. Its blue and silver sign was flapping in
the wind.</p>

<p class='c018'>When he came inside he saw the bakery woman
talking across the counter with a boy who carried a
basket of vegetables.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell your master that I say he is getting almost
too fine for his old friends, judging by the cake he
has ordered for next week!” the woman was saying,
and the boy answered:</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s not for himself. It’s for the seed merchant
where we stay when we come in with produce. Some
of his friends are coming together next week for a
dispute and supper!”</p>

<p class='c018'>The bakery woman shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c018'>“That’s all they do, waste good time chattering
like a set of magpies. Well, they’ll have the cake,
never fear! Now you can go to the back and take
a cup of coffee and a croissant, if you’ve a mind to.
Only do get that big basket out of the way, and
quickly, too. You’re right in front of a customer.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The boy went through the shop to the back where
he found himself in the midst of general confusion.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey selected a good-sized sponge cake
topped with almond icing. It was expensive and he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_179' id='Page_179'>179</a></span>
counted out his coins ruefully. He did not have a
great deal of money and he knew that he must save
enough for bribes, if need be. He took the package
of cake from the woman, who gave him only a passing
look, and went out.</p>

<p class='c018'>Raoul, the farmer’s boy, helped himself to a
steaming cup of coffee from a tall, white jug on
the table in the back room and selected a nicely
browned croissant from the plate beside the jug.
Then he shoved his basket over to one side and
looked about for a place to rest and eat. He had
been on his feet all day, and he was glad of the prospect
of a bite to eat and, perhaps, a nap. Beyond
the pantry room, at one side, were the kitchens,
from which issued a savory odor of baking and the
jangle of many voices; on the other side, at the back,
was something that looked like a storeroom. On
going into the storeroom, Raoul found that it was
filled with old boxes, bundles of paper, a broken
chair or two, and some tubs.</p>

<p class='c018'>He sat down on a dingy settle without a back,
in a dim corner of this junk room. At the other end
of the room was a short stairway leading to a
narrow gallery. The remains of an old bureau and
some more boxes were heaped up on the little gallery.
Raoul sipped his hot, sweet coffee and munched
his croissant. The warmth from the baking kitchens
and the quiet after his busy day made him drowsy,
and soon he was fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c018'>He woke suddenly and sat up. The bakery
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_180' id='Page_180'>180</a></span>
woman was climbing the stairway, carrying a tray.
When she reached the gallery she put the tray down
on the floor in front of a door which faced her.
Taking some keys from her waist she unlocked the
door and then picked up the tray. At that moment,
through the half-open door, Raoul caught sight of
a boy, who sat facing him on a window ledge in a
corner of the room.</p>

<p class='c018'>Raoul rubbed his eyes. He was not one to fancy
things. Surely he was awake and not dreaming!
He had seen a boy sitting on a window ledge in an
otherwise unused room back of the storeroom. He
had seen him distinctly. The light from a window
behind had shone upon the boy’s fair hair. He saw
the bakery woman unlock the door upon going in,
and he knew she had locked it again when she went
inside. He had heard the lock click. The boy in
the room must be a prisoner!</p>

<p class='c018'>Raoul picked up his basket of vegetables and went
quickly out, unnoticed by the bustling groups in the
kitchens and pantry.</p>

<p class='c018'>After she had bolted the door, the woman crossed
the room, and, putting the tray down on the window
sill beside her prisoner, surveyed him, her hands on
her hips. Lisle returned her gaze unconcernedly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“A nice, grateful kind of boy you are, to be sure!
Here I leave my patrons and my shop to come up
here with good, fresh milk brought straight from
the country by a market gardener, and crisp cakes
baked in my own oven this very day, and never so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_181' id='Page_181'>181</a></span>
much as a 'Thank you’ from you for all my pains.
Name of a name, but you’re a proud one!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle did not show any emotion at the bakery
woman’s words, and that is what she could not
understand. He had been snatched away from his
own home, this young aristocrat, at night in the
midst of a storm, and was a prisoner here in this
little room at the back of her bakery shop, held
under lock and key, his destination unknown. For
all he knew, he might be delivered up at any moment
to the Revolutionary Tribunal, which made short
work of aristocrats, old or young. Yet he could
look at her unconcernedly with his cold blue eyes.
Well, she had had nothing to do with the whole business,
except that it was her task to feed the prisoner.
She was not without a heart, and she saw that the
food was good. She had no use for aristocrats, old
or young—let them have their just deserts!—but
she could not see the sense of keeping the boy shut
up. Her husband did not confide his plans to her,
but she guessed that there was money in his scheme,
money or official position in one of the sections.
These sections had sprung up all over the city, and
each one hoped, in time, to make the laws of the
country. No doubt her husband was keeping the lad
until the right moment for handing him over to the
Revolutionary Tribunal. He would be a ripe plum
to present. That was their game. She was sure
of it!</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_182' id='Page_182'>182</a></span>
The prisoner was speaking to her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I wish to ask you a question. Could you tell me
if there is any other prisoner in this place beside
myself?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle asked the question simply enough, but he
listened eagerly for the woman’s answer. His unwinking
gaze held her eyes as she replied:</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is no one else. Do you think I make a
jail out of my good bakery? No! I’ve plenty to
do to feed the gay birds who come flocking in these
days. They think they’re all very fine, good Republicans
they call themselves, but to my mind their
heads are not any too safe on their shoulders. Each
one has his turn these days, and the mob is none too
fond of fine clothes!” She walked toward the door
as she spoke, and as she opened it, she said over her
shoulder:</p>

<p class='c018'>“You’ll do well to eat the cakes. They’re madeleines,
you know, the kind you bought when you used
to come to the bakery.”</p>

<p class='c018'>He smiled as he answered her. “I’ll eat them,
every one,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>He sat for a long time on the window sill, his
hands clasped about his knees, thinking. He still
wore the blue velvet suit in which he had been
dressed on the night of his abduction. The woman
brushed it for him each night. The fresh linen that
she brought him each day was coarse. She did not
ask him to wear the shabby trunks and smock which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_183' id='Page_183'>183</a></span>
her husband had given her for him; but there was a
streak of romance in her, and she admitted to herself
that she liked to see the boy sitting there on the
sill, in his velvet suit, and with the flare of ribbon at
the back of his neck. He was different from any one
that had ever been in her life, like some one in a
book of fairy tales.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle was thinking deeply, while he drank the
glass of milk and ate the cakes. He went over in
his mind the events of a fortnight ago—his sudden,
unbelievable capture, the rush through the fury of
the storm, then warmth, the smell of baking, this
room, and the bakery woman! He had never seen
his captors. They had left him blindfolded inside
the room, and the woman had come in shortly afterward!</p>

<p class='c018'>He knew that the bakery woman was kind and
he was grateful to her. He knew that as a prisoner
he might have had to suffer physically in ways that
he would have found it hard to bear. Here there
was no filth or misery. There was good food and
a comfortable bed. There was even a little mouse
who came out and wabbled its nose at him now and
then. He particularly enjoyed this because he had
read stories in which prisoners made friends with
mice and rats. It made his captivity more interesting
to him. He felt certain that the bakery woman
would not lift a finger to help him to escape, and
he was right. She was not of the stuff of which
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_184' id='Page_184'>184</a></span>
heroines are made. She would not do anything to
change the peaceful, even course of her bakery existence.
No, he must not look to her for more than
everyday comfort! Where, then, could he look?</p>

<p class='c018'>He thought constantly of Rosanne, more so than
of his mother, for he knew where his mother was,
or, at least, where she was supposed to be, while
of Rosanne he knew nothing at all, except that he
had left her singing in the salon when he went to
the cellar for the wood. More than anything else
he longed to know that she was safe. He did not
dare to mention her to the bakery woman, because
he did not want to call attention to her at all. There
was nothing then that he could do, but wait.</p>

<p class='c018'>He asked the bakery woman for ink and a pen
soon after his coming. She had protested at first,
but had finally brought him a dish of ink and a long,
fine quill pen. She herself used such articles only
for her accounts, writing not being one of her best
accomplishments. Lisle had explained to her why
he wanted them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is nothing to do, don’t you see? Nothing.
I have no books, and you have none to give me. All
prisoners have written accounts of their life in
prison. It is always done, and it will give me something
to think about!” he had said to her, and she
had brought what he wanted, when she had come up
again with his food. He had begun a sort of diary,
and once when the mouse came out from his hole
and winked at him while he was writing, he felt as
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_185' id='Page_185'>185</a></span>
though he might be a part of an old novel. He was
a prisoner writing his diary, and his one friend was
a mouse!</p>

<p class='c018'>These were his happier moments. There were
other times when he realized his dire position so
vividly that it seemed as though he must pound and
tear at the door until somehow he smashed it open,
but he knew that it would never give way. He knew
that his mother had gone to Great-aunt Hortense.
More than that he could not know, and he dared
not think too much about his people. When he
thought of Pigeon Valley, he found that it was Dian
who stood out among all others.</p>

<p class='c018'>Meanwhile, Dian had walked the city from one
end to another, making friends as was his wont. He
became acquainted with the market gardener and
went about with him to meetings of the different
sections. Now and then he spoke at the meetings.
When he spoke, the wrangling generally ceased for
a moment, and the people listened—but only for a
moment. They had no use for the message of love
that he had to give. Yet they showed no animosity
when his gentle, earnest face was seen among the
crowds and at public meetings. He never once lost
faith in his belief that the right way would be shown
him. He was grateful that he had met Raoul and
his master, for being with them meant being with
the people, mingling with them freely. He had
never gone through the Saint Frère house again, as
he did not wish to run the risk of meeting Henri.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_186' id='Page_186'>186</a></span>
Each night he slept in the hidden cellar and it was
there that he thought everything out. As he paced
up and down the rough, uneven floor, Dian thought
that he would give up all that the future held for
him of peace and quiet days to have Lisle walking
beside him.</p>

<p class='c018'>When the bakery woman came in to see Lisle
the next afternoon she brought with her the cake
she had baked for the seed shopman’s party. The
boy, Raoul, was to come for it at four o’clock. Her
man was going to the supper. There was to be
roasted suckling pig. Indeed, it was to be a fine
affair and much discussion was to take place.</p>

<p class='c018'>“They’ll talk, but they won’t get anywhere; they
never do,” sniffed the woman as she set the cake
down on the table. It was already placed in its wide
green box, and it was surrounded by soft pink paper.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a superb, a fantastic cake—four tiers of
golden fluff, with glimpses of cream and marrons
between layers and a gauze covering of spun sugar
holding it all in place. It was topped with a glittering
icing. The icing was festooned with candied
apricots and cherries, in the midst of which stood a
little spun-sugar figure wearing a tiny scarlet cap
decorated with a tri-color rosette, the emblem of the
revolution!</p>

<p class='c018'>The bakery woman was proud of her cake and she
did not attempt to conceal her pride. She pushed
one side of the fine paper away so that Lisle could
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_187' id='Page_187'>187</a></span>
see it in all its glory. Lisle was glad to show his
gratitude to the bakery woman for her kindness,
by expressing an interest in her cake. He was quick
to see beauty and cleverness, and he looked at the
cake with appreciation. “Magnificent!” he exclaimed.
Something in his sincere admiration, contrasting
with the dire peril of his situation, touched
the bakery woman so much that the tears came to
her eyes. She turned away, saying, “I’ll see if I can
make your cot more comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c018'>She crossed the room, wiping her eyes with the
back of her hand as she went.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was then that the thought came to Lisle, and
he knew that he must act quickly. He picked up the
quill pen and wrote these words on a scrap of paper:</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am Lisle Saint Frère, and I am a prisoner in
the bakery shop at 128 rue Saint Honoré.”</p>

<p class='c018'>He folded the paper and thrust it far back in the
corner of the box, almost under the cake. While he
did this he watched the bakery woman, whose back
was toward him, as she smoothed the blankets of his
cot. When she turned around, he was sitting as
usual on the window seat. As she came up to him,
he nodded toward the cake.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are a genius. I have never seen a cake like
it, even at my mother’s soirées!” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is a cake! Sacré bleu, it is a cake!” the bakery
woman exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It might be for a banquet of the gods!” said
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_188' id='Page_188'>188</a></span>
Lisle, leaning forward and giving it another look.
As he did so, the picture of past days in the schoolroom
at home rose before him—Le Pont reading
about Olympus, Marie Josephine pulling Denise’s
hair when the governess was not looking, Hortense’s
bored expression as she unwillingly took notes for
a composition they were to write on the “Iliad.” A
feeling of hopelessness came over him, but he smiled
one of his rare smiles as he spoke to the woman.
She put the green cover on the box and fastened the
paper all about it with a gilt cord.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There are no gods now but liberty and fraternity,
they say, but I say there’s too much lawlessness,
too much fighting and drinking, when every
one needs a sober head. That’s what I say!” The
woman shrugged her shoulders, lifted the box and
walked toward the door. “This cake is going to
them that have never tasted anything like it before.
No one needs to say, because I’ve risen in the world
I forget them that hasn’t.” As she said this, the
bakery woman went out and closed the door.</p>
<hr class='c022' />
<p class='c018'>The seed shopman, whose name was Soufflot, surveyed
his room with pride. It was the storeroom of
the seed shop. All along the center of the room
were two rows of rude benches put together to make
one long table. The walls were festooned from
one end to the other with tri-color rosettes and
streamers. At the far end of the room was a great
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_189' id='Page_189'>189</a></span>
banner upon which were the words “Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity, or Death” in bright red, white, and
blue letters.</p>

<p class='c018'>The seed shopman had little enough to offer in
the way of refreshment, his own nourishment consisting
of black bread and lentil soup; but he was
fortunate in having friends from the country.
Raoul’s master had brought a couple of suckling pigs
and had ordered a superb cake from the famous
bakery on the rue Saint Honoré!</p>

<p class='c018'>There were rows of tin plates along each side of
the improvised table, and jugs of thin red wine were
placed at intervals down the middle. From an inner
room came the smell of sizzling, roasted pig. The
cake sat in the center of the table. It was of so
regal an aspect that it seemed to have no part with
its surroundings.</p>

<p class='c018'>A clock somewhere near the West Barricade
struck nine. It was time for the guests to arrive.
Just then, the market gardener, who had contributed
largely to the feast, entered the room, Raoul at his
heels. Towering behind them, his grey cloak wrapt
close about him, hatless, and with the breath of
fields and woods that seemed always to hover mysteriously
about him, was Dian!</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ve brought in a man from the farmlands. He
met up with the boy, Raoul. He’s a shepherd and
he’s new to the city. He went to a sitting of the
convention last night and spoke some good words,
but those fools wouldn’t listen to him,” said the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_190' id='Page_190'>190</a></span>
market gardener. Having donated the pigs and
potatoes and the cake for the feast, he felt at liberty
to bring in whom he pleased to partake of it.</p>

<p class='c018'>Soufflot gave Dian a hearty welcome. His greeting
was interrupted by the loud trampling of feet
and the jangle of rough voices on the stairs, and the
next moment the party arrived!</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a noisy meal after the first hunger had
been appeased. The guests, whose food consisted
daily of black bread and garlic washed down with
poor wine, ate enormously, declaring that they never
knew that roasted pig could taste so good.</p>

<p class='c018'>When at last they had had enough of the pig,
they sat back and began to talk.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The aristocrats are going, going, going! The
guillotine is doing good work. But we must find
them all, we must not let any escape! Some of
them are getting away in spite of us, but, for the
most part, they’re safe under lock and key or, better
still, minus their thinking caps!”</p>

<p class='c018'>There was a loud laugh at the end of the seed
shopman’s remark, followed by a moment’s hush
as Soufflot’s wife lifted the great cake and began to
pass it around the table. It was so magnificent, as
Lisle had said, that it fairly took one’s breath away.
Most of the guests—tailors, blacksmiths, and tanners
from the Saint Antoine district—were in awe
of it, but after one taste they fell to with ardor. It
was good! Ah, but it was delicious, that cake from
the bakery on the rue Saint Honoré!</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_191' id='Page_191'>191</a></span>
It was slow work passing it about the table, for
it was heavy to carry. As Soufflot’s wife had no
china dish to put it on, she had left it in its green box.
Raoul regarded it yearningly. Would it ever reach
him! He had thought often of the boy in the room
above the junk room at the back of the bakery, but
he had not spoken of him to any one. He knew
that it was best to keep a quiet tongue in one’s head
and he had no desire at all to get himself into
trouble. It was no concern of his! He eyed the
cake gloatingly, and turning to Dian, who sat next
to him, he exclaimed: “How big it is! Madame
Soufflot cuts big wedges for everyone but still it
seems immense!”</p>

<p class='c018'>His turn had come and he eyed his portion delightedly.
He lifted the big piece in both hands and
delved into it, smearing his round face with cream.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian took the rusty, uneven knife and lifted out
his slice as Soufflot’s wife passed it to him. Then
she went on to the next man. Dian took his cake in
his hand, and, as he did so, he saw a stiff piece of
paper stuck tight to the melting sugar. It was heavy
and firm like writing paper, otherwise it would have
turned to a pulp, as the softer paper about the cake
had done. Dian unfolded it without thinking and
saw the writing on it. He glanced about him.
Everyone was deep in his cake and the discussion.</p>

<p class='c018'>He read the words written upon it.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am Lisle Saint Frère, and I am a prisoner in
the bakery shop at 128 rue Saint Honoré.”</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_192' id='Page_192'>192</a></span>
He crushed the paper between his fingers, grinding
it to bits with his nails. Then he sat silently
in the midst of the hubbub going on about him, his
head bowed over his clasped hands and in his heart
a prayer of gratitude.</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>It was the first of March and there was a hint of
spring about in spite of the bleakness of the streets
and the chilliness of the air, a faint suggestion of
warm winds coming, of new budding snowdrops and
wood violets. Humphrey Trail was homesick. He
wanted to see the first film of green over his Yorkshire
moors, to hear the call of mating birds, and
feel the busy, stealthy stir of wild things in the
bracken and across the downs.</p>

<p class='c018'>During the few weeks of winter that Rosanne had
been with her, little Vivi had been content to stay inside;
but now that the ice was melting and the robins
were singing in the Bois, Vivi wanted to be out in
the Paris that she knew, even in the midst of its
terror. There was nothing for her to fear. Humphrey
knew that he had no right to keep her a
prisoner, and as they walked toward the West Barricade,
he felt heavy at heart. They had left Rosanne
locked up in the little room with Minuit to
keep her company. There was nothing new for
him to work upon, no hint of Lisle’s whereabouts.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_194' id='Page_194'>194</a></span>
Always the soldiers stood guarding the house of
Lisle’s Great-aunt Hortense, the Marquise du
Ganne.</p>

<p class='c018'>Vivi chatted happily, holding his big hand confidently.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Very soon now I’ll be selling licorice water near
the gates. People will be very thirsty soon, and
many can not afford the wine. I shall make a little
trade every day.”</p>

<p class='c018'>It was early afternoon, and the sun shone bravely.
Groups of men sauntered about, talking loudly, and
soldiers of the Republic stood on guard close to the
gates. Children, black with soot and raggedly clad,
ran about, happy to get a breath of air after hours
of work in a near-by forge, where they helped their
mothers make waste for the guns. They danced
about in the sunlight, twisting in and out in the dance
that held all the mobs of Paris in its sway. As they
danced, they sang in their high, weak voices:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dansons la Carmagnole,</div>
      <div class='line'>Vive le son du canon!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Vivi knew some of these children. She ran up to
them and soon was dancing with them, glad of the
fresh air and the sun and to be out in the open
again. Humphrey Trail spoke to one of the soldiers
who was standing near the gates.</p>

<p class='c018'>“A good day for the people, this. Long live the
Republic!” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>The soldier gave a loud laugh.</p>

“You might be one of the five hundred from
Provence by the way you speak. Sapristi! I swear
I can not understand but a quarter of their jabber.
Look out there, you young brat, you’re always bumping
that basket around.” The soldier said this last
to a boy, who, running and carrying his basket at
the same time, flopped over on the ground, his head
falling against the side of the basket and his whole
face convulsed with laughter. It was Raoul, and as
he was so often about the gate he knew all the soldiers
and he was not in the least afraid of this one.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What a funny man! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I
had a bet with Guy Soufflot that I would run into
him and knock him over, just for the fun of seeing
him tumble about like a rubber ball. What a funny
man!” Raoul laughed up at Humphrey Trail as he
spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Is th’ so, my young lad, is th’ so? I’ll teach
tha better manners with a good stout stick, an’ tha
do not stay tha chatter!” exclaimed Humphrey
Trail, justly indignant at Raoul’s impudence. In
his excitement he spoke in English entirely, so the
boy, who did not understand a word of what he
said, only laughed the harder.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh, the funny fat man, and his funny way of
speaking. Come here and listen to him!” he called
to the Soufflot boy, who came running up to him.
Raoul had arisen to his feet, putting his hand over
his face as he rocked with laughter.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey made a dive at him and, catching him
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_196' id='Page_196'>196</a></span>
firmly by the arm, shook him until every tooth in
his head rattled like a castanet.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll teach tha to know respect for tha elders,”
Humphrey cried. At that moment some one spoke
close beside him and, turning, he saw so strange a
person that involuntarily he took his hands from
Raoul’s shoulders and stared. The newcomer, a
tall man, stood bare-headed in the sunshine, his red
hair falling about his grave, beautiful face. It was
Dian!</p>

<p class='c018'>“Whatever the lad has done he is sorry for it, and
he meant no harm. I can answer for him, I know
him,” said Dian. As he spoke he turned his clear
eyes full upon Raoul, who looked sheepish and
embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He’s such a funny man,” he said half apologetically,
reaching down and picking up his vegetable
basket, a smile still lurking about his mouth.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You have taunted him about his looks in a public
place, and he does not know enough of your own
tongue to answer you in kind,” Dian said quietly.
Then he turned and looked Humphrey Trail full in
the face, and it seemed as though at once, without
any need of word or explanation, the two were
friends. Dian’s smile was good to see as he held
out his hand and took Humphrey Trail’s broad one.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are a stranger, I see from your speech, and,
if I mistake not, you are English. You have come
to our country at a sad time.” Dian spoke slowly
and Humphrey understood all that he said and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_197' id='Page_197'>197</a></span>
answered warmly, though he still glowered over his
shoulder at Raoul, who was walking off with Guy
Soufflot. He continued to grin as he moved on, but
he did not call out again. Humphrey and Dian were
left together there, in that momentarily quiet corner
of the West Barricade.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I came to see a strange country last summer.
I’d saved a bit o’ gold, and I wanted a sight o’ the
world. Tha comes from the farmlands thaself, an’
I mistake not.” As Humphrey answered Dian he
felt his temper cool rapidly. He looked at Dian’s
bronzed face and grave blue eyes, and he felt a
strong desire to confide in him, to tell him the whole
story, of how he had remained in Paris to help Lisle,
had rescued Rosanne, and was now in a vortex of
worry as to what to do next. What he did say was:
“I stayed because I thought I might help. There
was a lad whom I thought needed me; and so he
did, but I wasn’t about the while he needed me the
most!” Something of poor Humphrey’s discouragement
sounded in his voice.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is a lad who needs me also,” Dian answered
in his rich, sweet voice, his eyes shining with
a deep gratitude. It was several days ago that he
had found the note in the cake at the seed shopman’s
supper, and he had known only thankfulness since.
He had not gone into the bakery shop, though he
had been near it often. He thought it best not to
attract attention to himself there, and he waited for
the moment when he should be able to get word to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_198' id='Page_198'>198</a></span>
Lisle in some way. Dian was not so amazed or
bewildered at the wonderful way in which the message
of Lisle’s whereabouts had come to him as
another might have been. He had known so many
things in his life to happen in just that way, and he
trusted always.</p>

<p class='c018'>Vivi came running up to them and took Humphrey’s
hand. She wore a ragged jacket over her
drab dress, and her black, untidy hair flapped about
her dark, eager little face. Dian smiled at her, and
she smiled back at him, as all children did.</p>

<p class='c018'>“She is like some one that I know well,” he said
to Humphrey Trail.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Now that is rare strange, for some one else has
said the same,” Humphrey answered as the three
made their way slowly from the west gate toward
the city.</p>

<p class='c018'>Vivi was excited. She had played and danced
and eaten a good piece of bread and garlic which
one of the soldiers had given her. When Humphrey
said with his few, slowly-chosen French words that
some one else had said she was like a friend, she
cried out unthinkingly:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, yes, the little lady said so. She called out
when you carried her in that night, 'She’s a little
like Marie Josephine!’”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian stood still in the street, his hand on
Humphrey’s arm.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Marie Josephine!” he repeated. “Marie Josephine!
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_199' id='Page_199'>199</a></span>
Are you speaking of the Little Mademoiselle?
I am shepherd to the Little Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“The Little Mademoiselle!” Humphrey stared
and stared at Dian, and so did Vivi. Rosanne had
spoken of a shepherd.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The Little Mademoiselle!” This time it was
Vivi who exclaimed, gazing up at Dian with her
great black eyes.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes,” he said gently. “You are like some one
we call the Little Mademoiselle, some one who is a
long way from here.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey Trail turned so pale that his face
looked not unlike the first glimpse of a full moon.
Dian saw this and spoke to him with concern.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is something that has surprised you, and
your worry has upset you!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Aye, I am fair flashed! Maybe it’s just the
worry and the crowds.” He hesitated, and in that
moment the angels must have been very near!
Dared he take this stranger to the alley? Was he
in some way a part of it all? Could it be, by the
wildest chance, that the Little Mademoiselle was—— But
no—Humphrey Trail caught Dian’s arm and
shook it. “As there is a God above, tell me I can
trust tha,” he said, and the shepherd answered him
at once:</p>

<p class='c018'>“You can trust me. It was meant to be so.”</p>

<p class='c018'>They walked through the rue Saint Antoine in
silence, Humphrey Trail holding fast to Vivi’s
hand on one side, Dian’s long, slow stride keeping
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_200' id='Page_200'>200</a></span>
pace with their short, quick ones. They turned into
the dark, dank alley. Humphrey opened the door
which sagged on its hinges. They mounted the
rickety stairs, waited while Humphrey unlocked the
door, and then went inside, Vivi running ahead.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanne was standing by the fire which was
smouldering sulkily in the rusty grate. She turned
at the sound of the unlocking of the door, and was
facing them when they entered. She saw Dian before
the other two, because he so towered above
them. For a moment she stood still as a statue.
Then with a cry that was like a sob she ran across
the room to him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='ch16' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter XVI</span> <br /> <br />MARIE JOSEPHINE IS READY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Spring had come early in Paris. It was a fortnight
since Dian had gone to the alley and found
Rosanne, since the wonderful evening when they had
sat by the poor little fire of broken boxes and talked
and talked. There they were in the heart of a city
that had gone mad, one of them in hiding to save
her life, all of them in gravest danger if once their
real purpose were known, but all of them so happy.</p>

<p class='c018'>When it was time for the two girls to go to sleep
on their cot, Humphrey and Dian went up to the
room above and sat, one on each side of the table,
pondering what it was best to do.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Th’ lad is there in the bakery shop. Tha found
his poor note in th’ cake. The Lord is good. What
a way! Odds me, what a way!” Humphrey muttered
to himself. His heart was full, but some of
his burden had rolled away. This quiet shepherd
of the valley was at hand to help. He knew where
Lisle was imprisoned and they could take counsel
together.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian knew no English, and Humphrey’s French,
as we know, was limited; but they managed to converse,
and from the first they understood each other.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_202' id='Page_202'>202</a></span>
“I have a friend of many a year who would be
fair willin’ to help us with a boat. He’s a skipper
of his own vessel, the <i>Sandlass</i>. They’ve made
young master Lisle’s mother prisoner in her aunt’s
house. It is not safe for any of the family to be in
Paris,” said Humphrey.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is not safe for any of the family to be in
France, not for any of them.” Dian repeated the
last words slowly, adding, “It soon may be unsafe in
Pigeon Valley!” He was silent for a few minutes,
and a deep gravity touched his face, an earnestness
that was like a prayer. Then, as he looked across
at Humphrey and saw the misery on his round face,
he smiled his slow smile.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You have done well and you speak words of
comfort. Tell me the name of your friend who
owns the boat and write him a letter,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey Trail looked at Dian in amazement.</p>

<p class='c018'>“His name is Anastasius Grubb. But what good
will that do? Tha knows well there is no way to
send a letter through the gates, or to be sure it will
reach my friend!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll see that the letter goes through the gates
safely, and that it is given to the driver of the coach
which goes nearest to the valley. I can trust him to
give it into the hands of some one who will put it in
the hands of your friend the skipper!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tha can do this? Tha can trust the letter to go
through?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, trust,” Dian nodded as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_203' id='Page_203'>203</a></span>
That was the conversation that Humphrey Trail
and Dian held in the rat-haunted room in the alley.</p>
<hr class='c022' />
<p class='c018'>A fortnight later the first breath of spring that
they had felt there in the sunshine by the West
Barricade had deepened into joyousness in Pigeon
Valley. A faint flare of green touched the tops of
trees in the forest, and a gleam of mauve and gold
showed the early budding of violets and crocuses.
There was a happy carnival of song birds early
every morning. The sun was warm at noontime,
and the nights were softly luminous.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was spring everywhere, except in the hearts
of the family at Les Vignes. There had been no
arrival of the messenger for whom they had waited
throughout the long winter. The comtesse had
sent them no word, and that meant that she had not
been able to do so. There had been rumors now
and then, even direct news, of the horrors of Paris,
brought by traveling peddlers, but there had been
no news from Dian at all.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was of this that Marie Josephine was thinking
as she put Great-aunt Hortense’s shawl around her,
and walked down the staircase at Les Vignes. It
had been the hardest thing to bear, not hearing from
Dian. She had felt so sure that he would find a
way to help.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was a look on Marie Josephine’s face
which had never been there before, a seriousness in
her eyes and about her mouth, a look of high purpose
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_204' id='Page_204'>204</a></span>
and of dignity. Madame le Pont noticed it as
she came into the salon. They were all sitting about
a fire of crisply burning logs, for the spring nights
were cold.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What is it, Marie Josephine?” she asked, and
as she spoke the governess rose from her chair and
came up to her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What do you mean, Le Pont dear? What is
what?” Marie Josephine said gently, and she put
her arm around Madame Le Pont’s waist and placed
her cheek close to hers for a moment. There was
something so wistful in the action that the governess
felt sudden tears springing to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are different in some way, chérie. You
seem so—what shall I say—so very much a
woman to-night.” Madame le Pont smiled as she
spoke, for she knew that her remark would please
her pupil greatly. She was surprised at Marie Josephine’s
reply.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I was just thinking about that to-night—being
a woman, I mean. I was wondering how it might
have been”—her voice trembled a little as she spoke—“if
we’d just gone on as we were, here and in
Paris; if there hadn’t been a revolution, and just the
same everyday things had continued to happen. I
was wondering what kind of a ball I should have
attended for my first one, and if I should have been
a belle!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“You would have been as lovely as your Great-aunt
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_205' id='Page_205'>205</a></span>
Hortense when she was belle of Versailles,”
put in Cécile from her seat by the fire.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You mean she will be. You speak as though all
this were going on forever, Cécile,” said Hortense,
fastening back a long curl with her tortoise-shell
comb.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Let’s dance, Spitfire,” suggested Bertran, sliding
across the room to her.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine nodded. “Yes, I would like to
dance. Will you play for us, Cécile?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Cécile stood up and went over to the spinnet.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’d love to play. See if you can do a gavotte to
the shepherd song I was trying yesterday. Do open
the jalousie, Bertran, the moon is trying to shine
in,” she said, seating herself at the old spinnet which
had helped them all to while away the long evenings
during the winter. Cécile needed all her courage
these days, for the governess talked more freely to
her than to the others, and she knew that things
were coming to a serious pass at Les Vignes. The
men on the place were leaving for the army. Most
of them had already gone. There would be no one
to till the ground. There was no one on whom they
could rely, now that Dian had gone, except Neville,
and his only idea of helping was to go again to Paris.
Dian had gone and they had had no word. Neville
must not leave them.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine enjoyed her dance with Bertran.
She wore the soft white silk brocade gown that had
been made for her thirteenth birthday, and, like
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_206' id='Page_206'>206</a></span>
Hortense, she had fastened her curls with a comb,
a large gilt one of her mother’s which she had borrowed.
When they finished, Marie Josephine made
Bertran a deep curtsy. She waited until the others
were talking and then slipped out of the room. She
drew the thick red silk shawl closely about her as
she stepped out on to the terrace.</p>

<p class='c018'>The moon was almost full, and its light seemed
to bring out each leaf and twig of the great oak at
the foot of the terrace steps with startling distinctness.
As she stood there in the radiance of the
moon, she thought she saw something move under
the tree. Some one shrank back into the shadow
and moved quickly into the deep underbrush. Marie
Josephine waited. She knew that, if it really were
any one, after he had gone through the shrubbery,
she would see him cross the clearing that led to the
forest. In a few moments she saw a woman pass
rapidly through the clearing, making for the wood
and going in the direction of the gates. The moonlight
had fallen full upon her and there was something
vaguely familiar about her figure. Marie
Josephine stood looking after her. Why was that
figure so familiar? Who could it be? Why had
she been hiding there in the shadow as though she
were spying?</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine’s mind was so full of another
thought that she did not dwell long on the apparition
of the woman, whoever she might be, for more than
a minute. Then she ran down the terrace steps and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_207' id='Page_207'>207</a></span>
disappeared in the direction of Mother Barbette’s
cottage. As she had guessed, Mother Barbette herself
was not in the cottage. She had gone to one
of the hovels to nurse a boy who had hurt his leg.
Marie Josephine called softly:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Jean!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean was sitting on the stone doorstep, but she
had not seen him in the shadow of the moon and tree
branches. He jumped up and came running to her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ve only come for a minute, Jean. Let’s sit
on the doorstep. Isn’t the moonlight wonderful?
We’ve had so much fun in the moonlight every summer,
haven’t we? We’ve been comrades, Jean,
great friends!” Marie Josephine put out the back
of her hand as she spoke, and Pince Nez, the crow,
lighted on it with a croak.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Pince Nez will be two years old in June. Do
you remember when Dian rescued him and brought
him to the sheepfold? I can just see him now, lying
on the shelf with his funny beak open.” Marie
Josephine stroked the crow gently, and Pince Nez
winked impudently.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean was sitting in the shadow, and as Marie
Josephine went on speaking, his eyes grew rounder
and rounder!</p>

<p class='c018'>“We must always remember what friends we have
been and be happy about it. You will grow to be a
fine man, Jean. I am sure of that. You must always
help Grigge. Dian would wish you to.” Marie
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_208' id='Page_208'>208</a></span>
Josephine paused and sat silently looking off at the
black outline of the wood.</p>

<p class='c018'>Suddenly Jean jumped up and stood in front of
her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell me, Little Mademoiselle, tell me what you
are thinking about.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am thinking how I love Pigeon Valley, Jean.”
She jumped up also and put her hand on his arm.
“I—oh, that’s all!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean spoke again, softly and quickly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are thinking of the plan, I know you are.
You are going to do that—no, I won’t say it, but
no one can hear us.” He lowered his voice to a
whisper. “You are going to run away to Paris. I
know you are!”</p>

<p class='c018'>They walked on through the wood path, and when
they came to the sundial, she turned and faced him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are always making up mysteries, you funny
boy,” she said. “I must run, for it’s past my bedtime.
Good night, Jean!” she cried over her shoulder.
As she ran toward the house the hot tears
chased down her cheeks. It was the hardest thing
she had ever experienced, not telling Jean what she
was going to do that very night!</p>

<p class='c018'>Cécile and Denise were sitting in front of a log
fire in Cécile’s bedroom when Marie Josephine came
in to say good night. Cécile was talking in her
gentle way and she looked up smilingly when Marie
Josephine came in.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I was telling Denise that we must make the best
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_209' id='Page_209'>209</a></span>
of this wonderful spring weather, and we’ve been
planning a picnic. What do you say to a lunch out
of doors in the birch woods soon, and a violet picking
expedition afterward?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine nodded. Her tongue was dry,
and for the moment she found it easier to nod than
to speak. She had wiped away her tears from her
face, but she felt them in her heart.</p>

<p class='c018'>Denise yawned and stood up.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I for one am sleepy. Bertran and I had a splendid
ride. It is stupid of Le Pont, though, not to
let us go out of the demesne just because that bailiff
person said it was not safe. Why, our roads about
Les Vignes are the safest in the whole world! Good
night; and let us each one dream of the true loves
we are going to have!” Denise laughed gaily and
twirled around on her blue satin bedroom slippers,
their crystal buckles sparkling in the firelight.</p>

<p class='c018'>When she had gone, Marie Josephine sat down
on the floor in front of the fire.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You look so perfectly dear to-night with your
hair caught up that way, Marie Josephine. I can
shut my eyes and see you as you’ll be four years
from now. The red shawl becomes you, too. Just
wait, you’ll have your true loves, I’m sure of that!”
Cécile said, leaning back against the dark brocaded
velvet chair.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine turned toward her eagerly. “Do
you really think so, Cécile? Ah, tell me,” as she
went on speaking she came close up to Cécile’s chair,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_210' id='Page_210'>210</a></span>
kneeling with both hands on the arm of it, “Cécile,
you will always love me. You’ll always trust me,
won’t you?” There was something so intense in the
look she gave her friend that Cécile leaned forward
and gazed at her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Why yes, yes, of course. What is it, Marie
Josephine!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I—oh, nothing—that is, let me just give you a
big hug.” Marie Josephine put both arms about
her friend and hugged her. Then she jumped up
quickly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Proté will be tired waiting up for me. Good
night, Cécile!” She ran over to the door, then
turned and waved her hand toward Cécile, who
waved back. Then she went to her own room.</p>

<p class='c018'>Proté tucked the bedclothes neatly about her
when she said good night. She was one of those
who could not think of Marie Josephine’s ever growing
up, and she spoke authoritatively as she blew out
the candle.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You must be careful about the chill night air,
Little Mademoiselle. It is not good, you know.
Keep well covered, and do not, I beg of you, go over
to the window to see the moon!” Proté’s round
face was serious. She felt a great responsibility
toward all the children, especially the youngest one,
the Little Mademoiselle.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Come here a minute, you funny Proté. Now
bend over and I’ll squeeze you tight. Proté, look
at Trudle. Hasn’t she a smug face? Never let
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_211' id='Page_211'>211</a></span>
them know that she sleeps with me. Can’t you
fairly see their horror! 'She is nearly fourteen and
she sleeps with her doll!’ Proté chérie, you are a
dear and I love you. Here’s one more squeeze!
Good night.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Proté returned her charge’s embrace fervently,
and then went over to the doorway. As she went
out she looked back at the little figure in the great
bed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Good night, Little Mademoiselle. God guard
you!” she said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine lay very still, the wooden-faced
doll beside her. She heard a clock strike ten and
then eleven, and after waiting a few moments,
jumped lightly out of bed, and going over to the
door, bolted it. Then, aided only by the moonlight
streaming in through the wide casement near her
bed, she went over to a cupboard and, standing on
a chair, reached back as far as she could and lifted
out a box. She jumped down and went over to the
bed with the box and opened it. She drew out a
shabby, rather soiled, black calico apron. She began
to dress herself rapidly, discarding her lace-trimmed
petticoat and putting on plain garments such as a
peasant child would wear. Over them she put the
black, smocklike apron. She went over to the dressing
table, and opening a drawer, fished about until
she found a pair of scissors. Then she began to
clip her hair. It fell in soft, warm waves on to her
shoulders and thence to the floor. When she had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_212' id='Page_212'>212</a></span>
finished, she looked into the glass and by the light
of the moon was able to see herself plainly.</p>

<p class='c018'>She saw a pale little girl with big, black eyes,
whose ragged, unkempt-looking black locks flapped
about her face! She smiled into the glass and the
forlorn, black-clad figure smiled back at her. Then
she put on a warm, worn jacket with a torn sleeve,
tucked a black handkerchief about her neck and
tossed back her uneven wisps of black hair. She
took a bundle from the box on the bed and, after
one glance about the room, unbolted the door and
went out, closing it softly behind her.</p>

<p class='c018'>She crept along the hall until she came to Madame
Le Pont’s room. She stopped by the closed door
and wrapped a note about the knob. After waiting
a moment and listening, she went back to her own
door. There was a whine and a scratch on the other
side. It was Flambeau, who had slept soundly while
she was dressing, but who had awakened and missed
her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Listen, Flambeau,” she breathed through the
keyhole. “I’d love to take you with me, doggie, but
I’m going where you couldn’t go. I want you and
Jean to go along more than, more than——” Her
voice trailed into a soft sob. This would never do.
She turned away and ran silently and swiftly through
the great house, unlocked a small door leading on to
a little balcony over the rose garden, and jumped
lightly down a distance of a few feet on to the soft
new grass of the east terrace.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_213' id='Page_213'>213</a></span>
Then she was off like the wind, her bundle under
her arm. She looked back once at the great house,
so silver white under the moon. She entered the
wood, so fresh and wild and sweet, on this early
spring night. Startled wild things in the bushes
stirred and scampered at her approach. She must
do one thing—she must have one last look at
Mother Barbette’s cottage. She stopped running
as she caught sight of it through the budding trees.
There it was, so warm and snug and red with its
straight, quaint stone chimney, its neat stone doorstep.
Marie Josephine looked and looked at it as
though she could never look long enough or hard
enough. Then she turned and walked slowly away.
As she entered the wood path again, she thought
she saw something moving in the shadow. She had
thought the same thing on her way to the cottage.
She could not be frightened in her own woods of
Les Vignes, but she started to run, and ran on and
on, taking the cut through the hedge near the gates
as Dian had done, and, like him, going to the huts.
She did not knock as he had done, but put her mouth
close to the keyhole.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Grigge!” she called, very softly. Almost before
she knew it the door opened and Grigge’s gaunt,
long face peered through the opening. When he
saw Marie Josephine he came out and closed the
door. He did not recognize her at first, and when
she spoke his astonishment was so great that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_214' id='Page_214'>214</a></span>
rubbed his eyes with his jacket sleeve and stared at
her open-mouthed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Listen, Grigge, I have only time to speak a word
with you. I am going to find Dian, and to help him
and the others, if I can. I want you to know. And,
Grigge,” she came a step closer and looked up at
him earnestly, “I feel that you can do so much here
among the people. For Dian’s sake, help us now.
I know that everyone is leaving us, and that there is
wild talking in the barns and through the fields.
Grigge, I know that you have nothing to be grateful
for to us, but will you not help us now? Stay and
care for Dian’s sheep. Do not join the wild crowds
in the townships.” She touched his arm in farewell
and was off, flying down the road as though her feet
had wings.</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge stood looking after her, so dazed that he
could not credit his senses. He had come out half
asleep and found a shock-haired peasant girl at his
door who had spoken to him with the voice of the
Little Mademoiselle! What was it she had said?
Do not join the wild crowds in the townships!
Little she knew of those crowds, or of anything but
ease and luxury. She was right, he had nothing to
be grateful for to a Saint Frère. He hated them
root and branch. He stood looking after Marie
Josephine as she sped away along the moonlit road,
as though he could not believe his eyes. Where was
she going, and what did it mean? Then some of her
words came back to him: “Stay and care for Dian’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_215' id='Page_215'>215</a></span>
sheep!” He went into the close hovel and threw
himself down on his oat-straw shakedown.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine ran and ran until she could run
no more. At last she sank down in the shadow of
a newly-budded oak, breathing hard, her bundle at
her side. As she sat there she heard a sound which
surprised her, a sound of swiftly running steps which
might almost have been an echo of her own! She
shrank back farther in the shadow. Some one was
running toward her through a dark side path of a
meadow close to the road. She stood up, took a
step forward, and cried, “Jean!”</p>

<p class='c018'>He sank down under the tree and for several
seconds could do nothing but pant painfully. At
last he took one deep, long breath and spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I almost lost you. You led me such a dance!
You ran as though you had lightning in your shoes.
I even called to you and begged you to wait, but you
did not hear!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine was so glad to see him that she
could not speak. Finally she said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“You came; but how did you know?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I just thought it was to-night from the way you
spoke when we sat there on the doorstep. I knew
that, because of Petite Mère, you would never let
me come with you, but I’ve come, I’ve come. I’ve
never been anywhere at all, and now I’m going with
you. I’m going to take care of you! We’ve come
a long way and we can’t go back! I watched for
you by the terrace. I crept out when I heard Petite
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_216' id='Page_216'>216</a></span>
Mère snoring. Then when I saw you, I followed
you. I hid behind the hedge while you talked with
Grigge. Name of a name, but he was dumb with
surprise. I ran near you along the meadow, but you
went so fast and I stumbled twice and fell. I’m
going with you. You can’t stop me. I’m going all
the way!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine jumped up and took his hand.
She was so glad that he had come that the tears
brimmed over and rolled down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s naughty, it’s awful—it’s wonderful! Oh,
I’m so glad you’ve come. We must not waste another
second here. We must not rest at all until
daylight.”</p>

<p class='c018'>They started to walk at a swift pace, holding
hands, the bundle flopping over Jean’s shoulder.
All about them was the sweetness and mystery of
the night, and before them, the lure of adventure!</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_217' id='Page_217'>217</a></span>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter XVII</span> <br /> <br />AT THE OLD GREEN MILL-INN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“It’s the old mill. We’ve walked all night and
we’ve only come to the mill!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine stood still in the middle of the
road. They had come out from the cool shade of
the forest road and the early morning sunshine
greeted them. The sky was faintly blue and everywhere
there was the sleepy twitter of birds.</p>

<p class='c018'>They had walked steadily all night, except for
occasional rests by the wayside.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We might have our déjeuner here, some hot
coffee and a petit pain. We can rest while we eat
it,” suggested Marie Josephine, and Jean assented
eagerly. He was too excited as yet to be really
tired, it was all so utterly new to him. He had
never been as far as the forest by the old mill in all
his life. He kept thinking over and over:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Petite Mère will soon be waking and she’ll find
that I’m gone!”</p>

<p class='c018'>As they came up to the mill-inn, a woman stood in
the doorway. When she saw her, Marie Josephine
stopped, hesitated, and would have turned away but
the woman said sharply:</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_218' id='Page_218'>218</a></span>
“What do you want, you two little tramps?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine answered, “We’re not tramps,
but we’re very hungry and want some breakfast. We
can pay for it.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“You’re not to say that she is a tramp,” put in
Jean indignantly, nodding toward Marie Josephine.
The woman paid no attention to him. She was
looking steadily at Marie Josephine, and as she
looked, Marie Josephine could feel the color come
into her cheeks. Could it be that the inn woman
recognized her as the young Mademoiselle who had
eaten déjeuner there the summer before? There was
something about the woman which was familiar,
something more than the remembrance of the summer
before. Marie Josephine caught her breath.
She suddenly remembered the figure she had seen
under the oak tree after dinner the night before.
She caught Jean’s hand and started to turn away,
but at that moment the woman gave an exclamation
and looked off toward the forest path. The children
followed her glance. There, coming toward them,
running lightly, and clearing a big mud puddle in the
middle of the road with a bound, was Flambeau!</p>

<p class='c018'>He leaped upon Marie Josephine, fairly devouring
her with kisses. There was no use in pretending,
Flambeau had given them away! He gave short,
staccato barks of joy, turning to jump on Jean, licking
his face and hands, and then turning again to
his little mistress.</p>

<p class='c018'>The inn woman looked from one to the other of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_219' id='Page_219'>219</a></span>
them keenly, her face now alive with interest. She
stared at Marie Josephine as hard as she could.
Then she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c018'>“The dog seems to know you well. I have seen
him before and, if I’m not mistaken, I’ve seen you,
too.” As she spoke, she pushed Marie Josephine
gently toward the door, looking over her shoulder
at Jean. “You can come in. I’ll have some coffee
and a bit of bread for you soon. You can rest
awhile, for you both looked fagged out.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine, though she was almost inside
the door, tried to pull herself away from the woman.</p>

<p class='c018'>“No, Jean, we’ll go on, we don’t want breakfast
here,” she said, but the woman had stretched out her
arm and pulled Jean in, too.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Don’t be stupid. Of course you must have food,
or you’ll not be able to take the rest of your journey,
wherever it is you’re going.” The woman spoke
kindly and shut the door after them. Flambeau
had been the first to enter the mill-inn, and he
bounded across the oddly-shaped room, still barking
his delight.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Well, what do you think of this for a good resting
place? See, there’s a window cut in the side over
there so you can see the forest.” The woman was
standing in front of the door, and as Marie Josephine
and Jean followed the direction of her finger,
and looked out at the road leading to the forest
path, she quietly and quickly turned the key in the
lock and put it in her pocket.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_220' id='Page_220'>220</a></span>
“Now I’ll tell you what you can do. Go up those
stairs and you’ll find a nice little room at the top.
It has tables and chairs just like this one, and there’s
a fireplace there. I built a bit of fire early, for the
mill gets damp even on spring nights. You both go
up there and rest, and I’ll bring your coffee up to
you. I’ll bring a bone and some milk for the dog,
too,” she said. Marie Josephine’s heart beat fast
as she listened. Did the woman remember how she
had fed Flambeau the summer before? Could it
be that she was the person underneath the oak?
This dark woman at the inn had been spying on
them at Les Vignes!</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine followed Jean up the funny
winding stairs. They found the room at the top.
There were tables and chairs in it, just as the woman
had said. They went over to a table near the small
fire. There were white muslin curtains at the single
window and a pot of geraniums stood on the sill.
It was a neat, cheerful room, and if she had not been
anxious, Marie Josephine would have loved it, for
the fact that the familiar, old olive mill, which she
had always known, had been turned into an inn
interested her very much. As it was, she turned to
Jean as soon as they had shut the door, and catching
him firmly by the arm, whispered fiercely:</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s not safe here. She’s a spy. I saw her under
our oak tree last night. I saw her going through
the wood. There’s a dark cloak on the chair by the
door downstairs. She wore it last night and she
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_221' id='Page_221'>221</a></span>
hasn’t been back very long, even though she did
have four hours’ start of us. She knows who I am.
Flambeau gave us away. She remembers him from
last summer when we stopped here for déjeuner.
Hush! I hear her!” Marie Josephine ran across
the room and, when the door opened, she was looking
out of the window. The side of the mill was
painted green and there was an eave’s trough along
it. An apple tree showing faintly pink and white
swayed in the early morning breeze, its branches
making a tapping sound as they flapped against the
rough wall of the mill.</p>

<p class='c018'>The woman Paulette came across to the fire and
put down a tray.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I had a sip of coffee early myself and so I just
warmed some up for the two of you. It’s cold in the
morning around here, even if spring has come,” she
said. “Draw up to the table now and make yourselves
at home. The brown bread will be to your
taste, and there’s honey in the blue dish. Here’s
milk for the dog.” The woman took a tin dish off
the tray and, bending over, called, “Come, doggie,”
as she put it on the floor.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine went over to the table and sat
down, and Jean followed her example. He was
astonished at what his friend had told him. Suddenly
he felt so tired after walking all night that
he was not a bit like his usual bright, eager self.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It does look good. There’s nothing I like better
than bread and honey!” Marie Josephine exclaimed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_222' id='Page_222'>222</a></span>
pouring coffee from a brown jug into one of the two
white cups and handing the cup to Jean. As she
spoke she smiled a little wanly at the woman. She
had spoken as cheerfully as she could and she hoped
that she had not let the woman see that she suspected
her.</p>

<p class='c018'>Paulette eyed them both shrewdly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll just go down and leave you to a quiet meal.
There may be a coach party in for lunch, for even
though it is out of the regular beat we get them
sometimes.” She crossed the room and went out as
she spoke. As she pushed the blue dish of honey
toward Jean, Marie Josephine felt her heart sink
and for a moment the lump in her throat was so
big she could not swallow. She had heard the
woman’s key click in the lock!</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean took a huge slice of bread and honey in his
two hands and bit a big half moon in it. He was
so hungry that it didn’t seem to him as though anything
else mattered very much for the moment, but
when he saw Marie Josephine’s face he put down
the bread and looked at her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It isn’t so bad here, Little Mademoiselle. The
woman seems kind enough. You couldn’t have seen
her at Les Vignes,” he protested.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine ate a slice of bread and drank
some coffee before she replied. “We must keep up
our strength,” she said. In spite of the peril of the
situation she almost had a thrill at the thought that
here indeed was an adventure, one that held all sorts
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_223' id='Page_223'>223</a></span>
of possibilities. She turned to Jean and her eyes
were as big as saucers as she said to him:</p>

<p class='c018'>“How many times must I tell you not to call me
the Little Mademoiselle? You are to say Jo. I’ve
reminded you twice already. You must remember,
Jean. We are locked in here and we are prisoners.
Don’t you understand?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean jumped up and ran over to the door and tried
it. It would not open. They were locked in!</p>

<p class='c018'>“She recognized me, but not for certain until
Flambeau came. Oh, how did he get out!” Flambeau
left his dish of milk and came up to Marie
Josephine at the sound of his name, and she put her
face against his back. “Flambeau, why did you
come? You’ve caused all the trouble. What shall
we do with you?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean was now fully awake to the situation and,
although he was frightened, he was excited and
alert. He nodded at Marie Josephine.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s come, hasn’t it? You know we’ve always
wanted an adventure! What would they say if they
knew at Les Vignes, Lit—” Jean caught himself
just in time, “Jo.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine had jumped up from the table
while Jean was speaking. She clasped her hands
together and put her face down on them, and the
tears trickled through her fingers.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We must get away, we must. Why, they will
discover that we’ve gone very soon now. It must
be nearly seven. They will be sending Neville to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_224' id='Page_224'>224</a></span>
find us, and his horse is fleet.” She caught her
breath with a sob as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s a long ride, and if we do get away I’m not
afraid that Neville will find us, for we are small
and can hide easy, Jo,” Jean said, and Marie Josephine
smiled faintly. She had no pocket handkerchief
and so rubbed her sleeve across her eyes.</p>

<p class='c018'>“How stupid I am to cry. We must do something
at once, Jean. We—but what can we do?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean ran over to the window and looked out. He
tugged at the knob, for the window shut like a small
door. Marie Josephine came up to him and when
he tired of tugging at it she tried to move it. It was
a little swollen by recent dampness, but after Jean
tugged the second time it gave, swung open, and the
fresh morning air greeted them. Something else
greeted them, too. It was the sweet pink and whiteness
of the apple tree. Jean leaned way out on the
window ledge and looked around, his eyes shining
excitedly. Then he turned and faced Marie Josephine.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s risky, but I think there’s a chance that we
can reach the tree. The eave’s trough, don’t you
see, holding on to the roof where it curves down!”
he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>She leaned way over and peered up at the low
roof and then down at the eave’s trough. It curved
down and ran straight across the side of the mill,
just below them. There was not a moment to lose,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_225' id='Page_225'>225</a></span>
for the woman would be coming back soon for the
tray.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We can try. But Flambeau! We can’t leave
him. Could he, do you think—would he follow
us?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean nodded. “I believe he would, and there’s
no other way. Yes, I know he would, for he’s always
followed us everywhere. I’ll go first, then
you, and you’ll see that he’ll come. He can balance
well. And oh, yes, don’t you remember the
time he walked the ledge of the summer house when
we were playing ship?” Jean whispered eagerly but
softly.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine nodded. “You go and I’ll follow,”
she whispered back.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean turned toward the table. “The bread, Jo!
You said you had money for food, and we need the
bread.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine felt in her pocket and drew out
a bag. In it were some coins and she put one on the
table. Then she handed the loaf to Jean and he
put it inside his blouse, buttoning his jacket over it.
He jumped up on the sill and, turning carefully,
reached up and caught the overhanging ledge of the
roof. Then he cautiously put one foot along the
ledge, drawing the other up to it, and in that way
made slow but sure progress toward the welcoming
branches of the tree.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine listened carefully, her eyes on
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_226' id='Page_226'>226</a></span>
Jean. When Jean was safe she turned and put her
hand on Flambeau’s head.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You’re to follow, Flambeau, and you’re not to
be afraid. You must follow,” she whispered. Then
she jumped up on to the window sill, turned, and
grasped the ledge of the roof as Jean had done.
She heard the swish of the tree as he caught the
branches, but she dared not look around. She did
not dare to think of the woman Paulette, and she
tried, for the moment, not to think of Flambeau,
but that was not so easy, for there was an appealing
squeal from the window sill. Then horrors! A
sharp bark!</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine called softly, “Flambeau,
come!” She held on to the ledge and looked back,
and, to her joy, saw the dog put his slender feet
on to the trough and gingerly step forward. “Come,
Flambeau, good doggie, pet, come!” she called
again softly. Then she turned, caught at the
branches, held them with every bit of strength in
her body, swayed with them, dipping down through
their leafy sweetness, loosening her hold the instant
her feet touched the ground. She swayed and staggered,
half fell over, but was up in an instant, and
with Jean looked upward at Flambeau. He had
reached the edge of the trough, and was looking
down. Soon they saw that he had spied what they
had not seen, a broad, thick branch some four feet
below the trough. He leaped down, scrambled
among the smaller branches for a moment, then
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_227' id='Page_227'>227</a></span>
jumped safely to the ground and ran with bounds
after the two friends who seemed to scarcely touch
their feet to the earth as they sped down the road,
away from the forest, the old mill-inn, and the dark
woman, Paulette!</p>

<p class='c018'>They often wondered afterward how they had
ever run so fast after their night of travel. Fear
seemed to race behind them, and they were sure
they heard the woman running and calling, but they
never looked back to see. At last they could not
run any longer. They came to a crossroad and sat
down near the edge of the road, panting and exhausted.
There was no one in sight and they rested
for some little time before they could talk at all.
Then Jean said, “There must be quicksilver in your
feet, Jo,” and they both laughed.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean laughed the most, throwing back his head
and shouting. He was so tired and excited that he
could not seem to stop. “You look so awful, Jo.
You are so untidy and dirty and ugly,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s good that I do look just this way, for no one
will know me. Poor Flambeau, see how tired he is.
If only he hadn’t come. But wasn’t he wonderful
there at the inn?”</p>

<p class='c018'>There was the sound of wheels coming the other
way, and they looked up and saw that a coach was
approaching. Flambeau ran toward it, and as he
came up to it, started to bark. The driver of the
coach stopped and looked at him, and then at Marie
Josephine and Jean.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_228' id='Page_228'>228</a></span>
“You both look fagged out. If you’re going my
way I’ll give you a lift,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>They came up to the side of the coach, and as
they stood there it seemed as though everything
went round and round before Marie Josephine’s
eyes.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We are tired, and so is Flambeau,” she said
faintly. Then she scrambled up somehow into the
back of the coach, and Jean followed her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We are going to Melon and beyond toward
Paris. I have cousins near Melon,” Jean said to
the man, and this was true.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was only one other passenger in the cart,
a fat market woman who kept muttering to herself,
and every now and then leaning over a wooden box
at her feet and saying, “Hush your gab. You’ll
squawk all the way to Paris, I know you will.”
The very disagreeable noise of imprisoned hens
answered her. Marie Josephine remembered feeling
sorry for the hens, and then she knew nothing
more, for she fell into the deepest sleep she had
ever known.</p>

<p class='c018'>She woke suddenly, sat bolt upright, and rubbed
her eyes. When she had fallen asleep she had felt
the sun on her face, but as she woke the soft glimmer
of stars greeted her. Jean was awake. He sat up
beside the driver of the coach, talking busily. It
was Flambeau’s caress which had roused her. He
was lying close beside her. The hens were quiet and
the woman was asleep. The kind man who drove
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_229' id='Page_229'>229</a></span>
the coach was smoking a pipe. Outside in the dusk
the good-night call of birds came to them drowsily.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You have to be very still when you catch them
or you will frighten them away,” Jean was saying.
“I always let them go. They are such dear little
things I always free them after just a little while.”
He seemed to be having the best kind of a time sitting
up there by the driver. Marie Josephine hoped
he would be very careful what he said, he was such
a little chatterbox.</p>

<p class='c018'>It had been so strange waking that way in the
coach, for she had been dreaming of Lisle and had
seen his face so vividly in her dream. He had on
the velvet robes of the “Sun King,” and the jewels
in his sword had sparkled as they had done on the
night that he had sat beside her on the bed and told
her that she was going to Les Vignes. What would
he say if he could see her now? He would not even
know that this funny, dirty girl was his little sister,
Marie Josephine!</p>

<p class='c018'>She had become used to the idea that she was
going to run away to Paris. But in spite of her
imagination she had somehow never quite been able
to visualize it. Now it was a reality! She thought
so much of the hidden cellar and of all that grandfather
had told her that spring day so long ago.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is to be your secret unless by disclosing it you
can save a life,” he had said. Paris, and all that
was happening there, seemed like a bad dream. She
had never really believed that anything could happen
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_230' id='Page_230'>230</a></span>
to her mother and Lisle. She often thought of the
“other one” who knew of the cellar, and wondered
if that person was helping, too. The waiting at
Les Vignes for news of maman and Lisle had been
more than she could bear.</p>

<p class='c018'>The cart stopped with a jerk, and the driver
turned his head.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Are you awake back there in the cart? Do you
hear me, girl?” he asked. “We’re almost at Melon.
Are you going on to your cousins, or what will you
do?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine was alert in a moment. They
must make the best of the darkness and of their
long rest. She judged that Jean had told the driver
to ask her, not knowing himself what she wanted
to do.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We’ll go on, thank you kindly. Come, Jean,”
she replied, climbing down the side of the cart.
Jean jumped off the driver’s seat and waved his cap
up at him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“That was a good ride and I slept enough to last
a week when those old hens got quiet!” He laughed
up at the driver as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>Suddenly a voice called through the darkness,
“Are you Champar, the driver to the Calais road?”
The next moment a boy with a round, honest face
came up to the cart.</p>

<p class='c018'>“That’s me,” the coach driver answered.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Well, do you go near Pigeon Valley?” the boy
asked.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_231' id='Page_231'>231</a></span>
“Not often, about once a month. I take in that
way on my next route, and then go straight on
toward Calais, but I have to détour so much now
it’s the hardest trip I have. I have to keep out of
the way of cannon, my boy, and the army, and
maybe fighting!” The driver spoke importantly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Well, anyway you don’t have any of that as far
as Pigeon Valley.” The boy came close to the cart
and spoke in a low tone. Marie Josephine could not
hear. Evidently the man made some emphatic statement
and the boy replied in a louder tone, “Never
mind, if you don’t go straight there with the coach.”
Then he handed the driver something white which
looked like a letter. Marie Josephine heard him
say:</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll see that he gets it safely.” With that, Champar,
the coach driver, whipped up his horses, waved
his whip at them all, and drove on.</p>

  <h2 id='ch18' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter XVIII</span> <br /> <br />VIVI SEES THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GATES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Raoul kicked one leg against the other. He
was ill at ease, as any one could have seen had they
taken the trouble to watch him. Soufflot, the seed
shopman, seated on an overturned box in the market
gardener’s room, was holding forth as usual to some
of his cronies. Dian sat apart from the others, his
hands folded on his knees. Raoul came up to him,
and stood before him, looking up at him. He had
gone with his master to the country the day after
he had made fun of Humphrey at the West Barricade,
more than a fortnight ago now, and so he
had not seen Dian since.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Good day, master shepherd. It’s a long time
since we’ve walked out together, but now that you’re
acquainted with the city perhaps you’ll not want my
company.” He hesitated a moment and then he
colored all over his honest face as he went on, “I’m
none too proud of taunting the funny fat man at
the West Barricade.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian smiled. “It was not a thing of which to be
proud, that I’m bound to say. One can go far if one
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_233' id='Page_233'>233</a></span>
has Humphrey Trail for a friend. The best thing
for you to do, if you are sorry, is to tell him so.
Mayhap you’ll be able to do something to atone for
it one day! As for a walk, I’ll be glad to go out
with you. There’s too much talking here, words
that do nothing and mean less.” As he spoke, Dian
rose to his great height and put his cloak about his
shoulders. He crossed the room and had his hand
on the knob of the door when something that Soufflot
said made him pause.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We can take what we want, that’s what we can
do. There was plenty of grab awhile ago, but things
are getting soft. I say let’s pillage!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“There’s plenty of plunder about. Last week the
jewels from a rue Royale shop were scattered from
one end of the street to the other. The aristocrats
and the anti-patriots are filling every jail in the city.
We are taking over the best houses now for official
headquarters.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“What houses?” It was Dian who asked the
question.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ve a list.” Soufflot’s friend, a blacksmith of
the Saint Antoine district, drew a paper from his
pocket as he replied. He was thought well of in his
district as a zealous patriot, and he enjoyed the
importance. “We were each given one of these lists
at the meeting of our section last night. I was sorry
not to see you there, farmer,” he said, looking across
at Dian, who still stood by the door. “Let’s see,”
he went on, “they still have a number of decisions
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_234' id='Page_234'>234</a></span>
to make as to houses for official headquarters.
There are any number whose former occupants have
gone—so!” As he spoke the blacksmith dashed his
hand across his throat, making a grating click with
his tongue against his teeth.</p>

<p class='c018'>The seed shopman laughed and so did the market
gardener. The blacksmith pondered over his list.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The hotel of the De Roumande family near the
corner of the square by the Pont-Saint Michel. The
hotel of the Framandes at 80 Champs Élysées, all
the hotels of aristocrats within two blocks of the
Place de la Concorde. The hotel of the Marquise
du Ganne at 90 rue du Paradis.” The blacksmith
chuckled. “The old bird croaked out some little
time ago. Our authorities took care of the interment;
and we’ve taken care of the niece, too; the
proud Comtesse Saint Frère. She’s there safe as
can be!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian opened the door and went out, followed by
Raoul. They walked away from the gates toward
the city. Dian was silent, thinking how best to take
the direction of the house of the Marquise du Ganne
without arousing Raoul’s suspicions. He felt thankful
enough when the boy spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I would like to see some of these houses of the
aristocrats. They say any citizen may go in. Let’s
go to the Framande house. I used to keep the cooks
there in stitches of laughter, turning somersaults
all up and down the kitchens when I brought the
fresh produce in.”</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_235' id='Page_235'>235</a></span>
Dian nodded assent. “Well enough then, if you
like. I, too, would not mind a glimpse at some of
them. You know the way, so I’ll follow your lead,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>They walked up the great wide avenue, turning
on to it from the rue Royale. Raoul looked back
over his shoulder. At the end of the avenue the
great giant guillotine showed black against a blue
spring sky.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll tell you something I saw, Shepherd, if you’ll
keep a quiet tongue in your head. There is a boy
shut up in the bakery shop, the big, smart one on
the rue Saint Honoré. I saw him quite by accident.
I’ve not told any one. He’s an aristocrat, I’m sure;
he had on a velvet suit.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Raoul then told Dian everything he knew as they
walked toward the Framande house. It was natural
enough that the shepherd should question him, and
he found out that, as far as Raoul could tell, the
prisoner had looked well, had been dressed in his
usual way, and had had a tray of milk and cakes
carried up to him by a woman whom Raoul declared
to be kind.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He could have worse than her looking after
him, whoever he is. She’s given me many a cup of
hot coffee and a cake on cold days. She’s good
enough; but the boy’s in bad hands if he’s a prisoner
of her husband! He’ll have him up before the
Tribunal for trial when the time is ripe. You mark
my words, he’s going to get some sort of plum for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_236' id='Page_236'>236</a></span>
himself out of this pudding!” Dian listened to
Raoul in silence, making no comment except to ask
a few questions. Since he had found the note in the
cake he had waited quietly for the next development.
He trusted that he would be shown the right
way and he had spoken confidently to Humphrey
Trail when that impetuous soul longed for action.</p>

<p class='c018'>He was thinking of Humphrey and of Rosanne
as he walked with Raoul along the Champs Élysées.
He saw Humphrey every day and he knew that
Rosanne was safe with Vivi, but he realized, as did
also the Yorkshire man, that Rosanne must not remain
longer in the alley. Vivi was out now playing
about the gates and plying her father’s trade of
selling licorice water. She was the best little soul
in the world, and she loved Rosanne, but she was
very young and she had never learned to keep things
to herself. She might, without meaning to, say
something which would cause suspicion and bring an
investigating body of citizen soldiers to the alley.
There was only one place where Rosanne could be
safe until the opportunity came to take her out of
Paris, and that was in the hidden cellar.</p>

<p class='c018'>They found a noisy mob about the Framande
house and sights that were bad to see, for the crowds
were out looting and robbing and killing. They
turned away, glad to be on a quiet street, and walked
on in silence a few minutes. Then Dian said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“There were other houses. There was one on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_237' id='Page_237'>237</a></span>
rue du Paradis, the Du Ganne place, was it not?
Let us see what is going on there.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Raoul nodded. “I know that one well, too. The
old lady used to give great parties. She’s dead now,
and her niece is prisoner there. I’d like to have a
look at her!”</p>

<p class='c018'>The house of the Marquise du Ganne was gloomy
and big and forbidding. At the wide entrance door
they were challenged by a soldier in the uniform of
the Republic, who called:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Who goes there? Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,
or Death!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian and Raoul answered: “Friends. Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity, or Death!” and went inside.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the center of a long hall some men in uniform
sat writing at a table. Citizens of Paris, some rough
and ragged, walked about, but, for the most part,
the place was quiet. One of the men glanced up
from his writing and, when he saw Dian, nodded
and beckoned to him. Dian went over to the table,
recognizing him as one of the men who had attended
Soufflot’s supper.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Could you do me the favor of glancing at this,
Shepherd? They say you know how to write and
read well, and that”—the man peered up at Dian
as he spoke—“that seems a passing strange thing
for a shepherd.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“The evenings are long in the country districts,
citizen. I have worked through them until late into
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_238' id='Page_238'>238</a></span>
the night to glean the little knowledge I possess.
But what is it I can do for you?” Dian replied.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Just take a look at this notice I’ve written out
and see if it’s readable to your eyes. Marat can’t
do much more than write his name, so why should I
care about doing any better?” As he spoke the official
handed the sheet to Dian, who bent over it.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There are some words I could change for you,
and with your permission I’ll do it,” Dian said. The
man consented and Dian sat down at the table and,
painstakingly and slowly, corrected the garbled writing.
Then he read it out to the official, who nodded
with approval.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You’ve done that well. You are clever, I see,”
he commented, taking the paper from Dian and
leaning back in his chair and yawning.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian was silent for a minute. He wanted to ask
if there was any possibility of going through the
house, hoping to get a word with the comtesse as
he went through. He did not know just how to
word his request without arousing suspicion. Raoul
helped him out. He ran up to the table just then.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh, citizen Parnette, do let us see the prisoner.
Just one look is all I want,” he begged.</p>

<p class='c018'>Citizen Parnette frowned. What an impudent
youngster this messenger boy of his friend, the
market gardener, was, to be sure!</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s not done, as a rule. They’d be up there,
every last one of them, if they knew we had an aristocrat
in keeping. Well, it won’t be for long now.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_239' id='Page_239'>239</a></span>
She will go to La Force I daresay. You can have
a look for friendship’s sake, but keep a quiet tongue
about it. Go up the back stairway and straight down
a hall. She’s in a room at the left and you can see
her because the upper corner of the door is broken
through. The mob did that when we first took the
house over. She was in the west wing then, but we
moved her to the other side.” The official bent over
his writing, and Dian and Raoul went on through
the long hall to the back of the house.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Go on ahead of me, my lad. I’ll warrant you’ll
take the steps three at a time, and I would take my
leisure,” Dian said to Raoul as they came to the
foot of a long flight of stairs. How often had the
old comte spoken to him of this house of his aunt’s
where he had spent so many days of his youth!</p>

<p class='c018'>Raoul ran on up the steps three at a time, just as
Dian had said he would. When he was well on in
front, Dian took a small notebook and a piece of
charcoal from the inner pocket of his cloak and,
placing the book against the tapestry wall at the side
of the stairs, wrote these words:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tear this after reading. Lisle is imprisoned in
the bakery shop at rue Saint Honoré. I shall find
a way to save him and to save you. Mademoiselle
de Soigné is safe with friends. Keep up your
courage. Dian.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then he went on up the stairs and down the hall.
Raoul was already looking through the small, shattered
paling at the side of the heavy, nail-studded
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_240' id='Page_240'>240</a></span>
door. There was a red brocaded curtain in front of
the door. Raoul looked back over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c018'>“My, she’s grand and solemn looking. She’s sitting
by the window!” He moved away so that
Dian could peer through. The shepherd hesitated.
It was not to his liking, this looking in on a woman,
but he wanted to see what the room was like and to
pass his note to the comtesse. He put his eyes to
the opening and saw the comtesse sitting, as Raoul
had said, by the narrow window, dressed in her
black frock, her hands folded in her lap.</p>

<p class='c018'>Raoul had roamed on down the hall, peering in
at doors and shuffling his feet along the velvet carpet
as he went.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian said softly, “Come to the door, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The comtesse heard him, gave a start, and then
came quickly across the room, both hands at her
heart. She saw his face and recognized him at once.
There was no time for more than a word. He
dropped the note at her feet, whispering, “Be ready
when I come.” Then he turned away and joined
Raoul, who was already shuffling toward him.</p>

<p class='c018'>They walked back toward the West Barricade
together, and, as they walked, Raoul asked inquisitively:
“Why do you not take us to your lodgings?
Where is it that you stay?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am lodging with friends. It is a dark, cold
place, and there are rats about; but, because it is
my friend’s house I am well pleased at being there.
Listen to me well, Raoul! Would you like to prove
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_241' id='Page_241'>241</a></span>
yourself a lad to be trusted? You say you are sorry
for hurting the honest farmer, Humphrey Trail.
Would you like to do him a service?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Maybe,” answered Raoul in his teasing way;
but Dian knew that he was teasing.</p>

<p class='c018'>“See, Raoul, I am treating you as a man. I am
trusting you. Does that mean something to you?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Raoul nodded. “Yes, Master Shepherd, I like
you. I would serve you,” he answered simply.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Then listen well. I would ask you to take a
letter to Champar, the cross-eyed coach driver on
the Amiens road. The crossroad where he turns
toward Melon is only a few miles from your
master’s farm. You are simply to hand him the
letter and say nothing.” Dian looked down earnestly
at Raoul’s simple, round face.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You may trust me right well, Shepherd,” Raoul
said. “I’ll see that Champar gets the letter safe
enough.”</p>

<p class='c018'>They had reached the gates, and they stood for
a while watching the carts go through. Suddenly
they saw Vivi. She carried a tray from which
dangled a row of tin cups, and on the top of which
was balanced a tall pewter jug.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Licorice water, licorice water! Who’s thirsty?”
she called out at intervals, and she did quite a thriving
trade as she went about among the people.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Hi there, girl, another cup for me. Sacré, it’s a
poor drink, but I don’t see any wine kegs about,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_242' id='Page_242'>242</a></span>
and it’s thirsty work seeing that no aristocrats get
through the gates,” said a soldier coming up to her.</p>

<p class='c018'>Vivi grinned at him from under her straggling
black locks as she poured some of the sweet grey
mixture into one of the cups. She liked to have
adventures so that she could tell Rosanne about
them at night. She meant to stop at a little shop
she knew on the rue Saint Antoine and buy a bit of
sweet cake as a treat for Rosanne’s supper. Now
that she had a few pennies to spend she liked to buy
some little thing to cheer her friend, for whom the
days dragged slowly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Let me go through the gates, Georges Fardou,
just for fun,” she pleaded.</p>

<p class='c018'>The soldier in charge gave a good-natured laugh
and looked down at her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“That’s so, you’re poor old one-legged Ranboeau’s
brat. That was a bad deal your father
got when the lumber fell. Let you through the
gates, is it? What would you do on the other side?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Pick some flowers and come right back,” answered
Vivi, hitching up the tray which was held
about her neck by a leather strap.</p>

<p class='c018'>The soldier in charge laughed and turned to
another.</p>

<p class='c018'>“She wants to pick some flowers on the other side
of the gates. Well, go through and see how many
you’ll find!” He held open the gate far enough for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_243' id='Page_243'>243</a></span>
Vivi to step through, and they all laughed at her as
she looked about curiously.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s a great sight, isn’t it? No one was curious
until they had to stay this side, but since the gates
have been locked you’d think they thought the fields
of paradise were just near by,” laughed Georges
Fardou.</p>

<p class='c018'>There were no flowers, only a long stretch of
road, the vanishing bulk of a market cart in the
distance, and the vivid spring sky above. Vivi
looked about her and then, putting her tray down,
began to dance and sing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dansons la Carmagnole,</div>
      <div class='line'>Vive le son du canon!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The soldiers looked on, calling out approvingly:</p>

<p class='c018'>“That’s good. She might be a sans-culotte herself!
Give us the 'Ça Ira,’ too!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Vivi danced and sang with all her might, enjoying
the attention she got very much. When Fardou
called her, she picked up her tray and came inside
the gates, making a bow to the guard, who bowed
mockingly in return.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Thank you, citizeness, for the entertainment.
We shall see you one day at the Comédie Française,
I daresay,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Thank you, Georges Fardou, for letting me outside
the gates. It is not so nice there as I thought.”
She swung her leather strap over her shoulder and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_244' id='Page_244'>244</a></span>
went on crying her wares: “Licorice water, who
wants licorice water!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian left Raoul and went to Humphrey Trail’s
room in the alley. He had not expected to find
Humphrey in, but was only too glad to see his broad
kindly face looking around the corner of the door
as he came up the stairs.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ve seen Madame Saint Frère,” Dian said as
soon as he came into the room. Then he proceeded
to tell Humphrey all about the morning.
Humphrey’s face shone.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tha has done well and there’s now a bit o’ light
ahead. Th’ young lad, to think, he is in the bakery
shop. How shall we save th’ lad?” Humphrey
wrung his fat hands together as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We shall do it, Humphrey Trail, and, if I have
done well, you have done better, for though I have
dreams and the hope that they will come true, you
have already saved a little girl.” Dian smiled his
slow smile and Humphrey Trail answered him:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tha has something more than I ha’! Tha has
trust!” As he spoke Humphrey sighed, longing for
the confidence which made Dian so sure that Lisle
would be rescued. He thought of the letter which
Dian was holding until he found the right messenger
to deliver it to Champar, the trusted coach driver,
who would, in turn, give it into the hands of Grigge,
who lived at the gates of the Saint Frère demesne.</p>

  <h2 id='ch19' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter XIX</span> <br /> <br />IN THE BAKERY SHOP AND OUT OF IT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The baker from the rue Saint Honoré was so
cross that he glowered at his wife when she handed
him a cup of steaming, nicely sweetened coffee and
a plate of cream buns. He was worried, which was
one reason for his being cross. He snapped out
these words as he took a long drink of the good
coffee:</p>

<p class='c018'>“There’s no telling what will be standing from
one day to the next. They’re looting and burning
everything that takes their fancy! They’ve got the
idea this place is too aristocratic. They know it
used to be serving royalty. You mark my words,
they’ll get us yet!” The baker put his head in his
hands with a gesture of despair.</p>

<p class='c018'>He meant the mobs which went from one end of
the city to the other, plundering and stealing and
destroying everything upon which they could lay
their hands. They were mad with hunger, many of
them, and there was no one to guide them; rather
were they encouraged in their lawlessness by the
very men who should have curbed them, and they
lost all semblance of civilized beings.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_246' id='Page_246'>246</a></span>
“You’re as bad as any of them, keeping that boy
a prisoner upstairs. Why don’t you put on a uniform
and go out with our brave soldiers and fight
for liberty in a clean way, instead of staying at home
and turning coward and villain!” exclaimed the
bakery woman with sudden courage.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll ask you to keep a civil tongue in your head
and I’ll have no more of your spoiling of that boy.
What he needs is a little wholesome discipline, with
his proud face and haughty ways. I couldn’t get a
word out of him when I went up there last night;
but I’ll try something more persuasive than words
if he doesn’t look out. I’ll not put up with his impudence,
and I’m going to find out if he knows anything
of where the girl might be. I’m going to find
out now!”</p>

<p class='c018'>The baker finished his coffee with one long gulp
and rose from his chair in the outer kitchen. It was
evening, and because of the bad times in that quarter
they were closing early. He went through the storeroom,
up the stairs to the room where Lisle was.
He unlocked the door and went in, closing the door
behind him.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle was standing by the table. As the baker
came up to him he pushed aside the paper and pen
he had been using.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ve come for a word with you and you’ll do well
to answer me straight. Where do you think the
girl may be?”</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_247' id='Page_247'>247</a></span>
The baker came close up to Lisle and regarded
him severely. Lisle returned his look steadily.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What girl?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You know well enough what girl. You left her
there in the room of your house when you went to
the cellar for wood. She wasn’t to be found when
we looked for her. She wasn’t anywhere about.
You’ll have to say where you think she may be, and
you’ll have to say it quick!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle smiled, leaning back against the side of the
table and looking the baker over impudently.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You don’t look as stupid as you sound,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Is that so, you young high and mighty. I’ll find
a way to take you down a peg. I’ll have none of
your impertinence. You’ll give me civil words and
you’ll give me a straight answer or I’ll give you
something you’ll not relish, that I can tell you.
Where is the De Soigné child?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I don’t know where she is. I haven’t any idea,
but I’m glad she’s safe from you. Who knows,
perhaps some one has come to her aid. That’s what
I’m hoping.” As Lisle spoke, Humphrey Trail’s
honest face came into his mind, and with it a certain
confidence. Often during these past weeks he had
thought of Humphrey, and gone over in his mind
their last meeting. His pride had not let him take
Humphrey’s advice and he had kept on with his
visits to the bakery shop. He would have given a
great deal to have seen Humphrey just at that
minute. There was only one other person whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_248' id='Page_248'>248</a></span>
he would rather have seen, and that was Dian, the
shepherd.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There’s one thing I know,” cried the baker, “and
that is you need a good taste of a whip. And, as
sure as my name’s Charles Tortot, you’ll get it this
very night. I’ll see to it that you shed some big
tears before you’re many hours older, my fine fellow!”
The baker was so angry that he stuttered
as he spoke, and his temper was not improved by
Lisle’s next remark.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You couldn’t make me cry and you know it. I’m
not afraid of you, and I think you know that, too,”
he said. He was still leaning back against the table,
his hands on the side of it. The baker glared at
him but he had to admit to himself that his prisoner
certainly did not look frightened, no matter how he
may have felt. The baker looked at him for a
moment, at his blue velvet suit, the freshly washed
lace frills at his wrists, his white face and blue eyes,
and the bright gold of his hair, tied back with its
flare of ribbon. A silly whim of his wife’s and one
that he should put a stop to. He stood there frowning
at Lisle in the dusky twilight, and Lisle’s proud
eyes frowned back at him.</p>
<hr class='c022' />
<p class='c018'>Dian came in through the alley and climbed the
rickety stairs to the room on the first landing. He
had seen Raoul go through the gates an hour before,
and knew that with him had gone the letters, one
to Champar himself, and one for him to deliver to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_249' id='Page_249'>249</a></span>
Grigge in Pigeon Valley. He was thinking of Lisle
as he climbed the stairs, trying to plan out the best
way to get a message to him.</p>

<p class='c018'>He knocked on the door and said, “This is Dian,”
and Vivi opened it for him, smiling a welcome.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Dian, stay and talk with us. I have told Vivi
everything I know and she has told me so many
funny things about her life, but we’re tired now.”
Rosanne came running across the room as she spoke,
and, catching hold of the shepherd’s hand, drew him
over by the window. He noted that she was pale,
and for a moment his heart sank. Like Humphrey,
he felt a responsibility for them all, but, unlike him,
was able, after a moment, to banish his forebodings.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You will have many adventures to talk over
with your friends when you are an old, old woman,
Mademoiselle,” he said to her smilingly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“See what we have for supper! Humphrey
brought us garlic and some fresh lettuce,” Rosanne
went on, trying to be cheerful, and receiving a reward
in Dian’s pleased smile.</p>

<p class='c018'>They had put an overturned box by the one small
window and had spread their supper on it. The
lettuce and garlic reposed in a tin plate in the center
of the improvised table, and a loaf of bread lay on
a clean piece of paper at one side. Next to the plate
of lettuce was a small glass filled with a few early
violets. Dian came up to the table and stood looking
down at it and at Rosanne. He touched one of
the violets with his finger.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_250' id='Page_250'>250</a></span>
“A farmer woman gave them to me. She was
sitting in her cart near the west gate. I told her
that I had some young friends who would love
them,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Dian, they are like those at Pigeon Valley.
Dian, think of it—Pigeon Valley. I was telling
Vivi just now about the lilies on the south terrace
at Les Vignes, clusters, crowds of them, white and
gold. They’ll bloom in June, Dian!” Two tears
rolled down Rosanne’s face, but she smiled through
them. “I want to see Marie Josephine more than
ever to-night. I——”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian put his hand gently on her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are brave,” he said, and then turning toward
Vivi he added: “Vivi is brave, too. She is helping
us all the time.”</p>

<p class='c018'>It was the best thing in the world he could have
said, for Rosanne forgot herself at once and thought
of Vivi.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, she is the best friend. She is so good to me.
When she comes in she has always something for
me, and when I am restless she dances for me, and
then I dance for her. She has learned to do the
minuet with me nicely, but she likes her own dances
better.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Vivi followed Dian to the door when he went out,
and as he opened it Minuit came in, rubbing herself
against him as she passed him.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian walked toward the city. The sky was bright
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_251' id='Page_251'>251</a></span>
with stars. He thought of the stars as they shone
on the meadows of Les Vignes.</p>

<p class='c018'>When he came to the corner leading into the rue
Saint Honoré, he stood still. There was the way
of the Champs Élysées, in the evening always the
more quiet of the avenues. The tumbrils, which
passed there all day, stopped at sundown when the
guillotine finished its day’s work, and the crowds
gathered along the rue Royale or about the Place
de la Bastille, or down the length of the rue Saint
Honoré.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian hesitated. He felt so tired of crowds,
even of the thought of them, and, like Rosanne,
he wanted Pigeon Valley. Still he hesitated. Years
before, one wild, cold night, he had been a good
distance from Les Vignes and had been coming home
late. There had been two roads. One he knew
well, for it led straight across the fields to his sheepfold
door; the other was over rough stubble, hard
and uneven from the early frost. One was easy
going and he knew every inch of it, the other was
uphill and a long way around. He took the difficult
road, and halfway to Les Vignes he had come across
one of his lambs, half dead with cold. It had
strayed from the others and lay helpless and bleating
on the stark hillside. He had lifted it and carried
it home under his cloak, warmed and comforted.
Something had told him to take the harder path, and
the same trust had led him through it. He turned
toward the rue Saint Honoré and as soon as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_252' id='Page_252'>252</a></span>
was halfway down the street he found himself one
of a wild mob. All about him hoarse voices were
screaming. He was carried along with the pressing
crowd.</p>
<hr class='c022' />
<p class='c018'>The baker was angry at Lisle, but he was curious,
too. He had never seen any one like him. He had
threatened to whip him and yet Lisle had still dared
to defy him about the girl, and had spoken with an
amazing impudence. Tortot went toward the door.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We’ll see if I can’t rid you of some of that impertinence,
my fine fellow,” he snarled.</p>

<p class='c018'>While the baker had been speaking, there was a
strange roaring sound somewhere in the distance,
and when he finished it seemed to be very near. He
paused uncertainly and his face showed white in the
growing dusk. He ran over to the door and opened
it, and as he did so there was a frightful crashing
sound of breaking glass, mad shouting, then another
crash, and the sound of a door being broken down.</p>

<p class='c018'>Tortot stood as one dazed, but even in his fright
and bewilderment he had presence of mind enough
to put himself in front of the door as Lisle made a
rush for it. The baker’s broad bulk completely
barred the way and he was quick enough to prevent
Lisle from ducking under his arm. There was the
sound of tables and chairs being overthrown, more
shouting, and then the bakery woman’s voice calling
lustily:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Charles, Charles, they are destroying us!”</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_253' id='Page_253'>253</a></span>
It was only for a couple of minutes that Lisle and
the baker struggled in the doorway. Then there was
a burst of sound from the kitchens, the crash of
pewter and iron cooking pans and tins being thrown
down, voices harshly singing the “Ça Ira,” and the
next instant a tall figure, with ragged red locks
about his shoulders, swung himself up the stairway,
knocked the baker down with one fierce thrust of
his arm, and catching Lisle about the waist, threw
him up over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c018'>He was down again like a flash, through the storeroom
to the bakery shop where confusion reigned.
Cakes were scattered broadcast, and broken china
dishes lay in scattered heaps on the floor and
counter. Dian with one quick, strong gesture had
flung his cloak about Lisle as he ran with him down
the stairway. Holding him close in his arms he ran
on through the shop, out into the freedom of the
streets!</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian ran steadily and easily. He was used to
long stretches of countryside, but he was not used
to the tortuous, winding streets of Paris. He knew
that some of those in the shop must have seen him,
but as he had completely covered Lisle with his
cloak he hoped that, had any one given him a
thought, it would be only to surmise that he had
run off with some especially choice piece of loot.</p>

<p class='c018'>He turned in and out of several narrow, twisted
streets, and at last stopped for a moment in the
shadow of a doorway. He listened but could hear
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_254' id='Page_254'>254</a></span>
nothing but the usual roar of the city all about them.
Then he put Lisle gently to the ground, throwing
the cloak back so that he could see his face in the
dim light.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s Dian, Little Master,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle, having been for several weeks confined in
one small room with little fresh air, and having nothing
to eat for the last two days, or at any rate, only
enough to appease the bakery woman who had been
concerned at his indisposition, was dazed and weak.
He had been threatened one moment by the baker,
and the next moment grabbed by some one, covered
with a cloak, and run with at a tremendous pace,
and now in a doorway in the heart of Paris, Dian
was holding him, speaking in quiet, familiar tones.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle put his head down in the hollow of his arm
and stood very still for a moment.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We’re going home, Little Master. We’ll be
there soon,” Dian said again, and Lisle turned
toward him as children and animals always did.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, home,” he said weakly, but when Dian
offered to carry him, he shook his head.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s better so, Little Master, for dressed as you
are you will not be safe in the streets. It’s near now,
and soon you’ll be safe and quiet.” Dian lifted him
as he spoke and walked quickly with his long, easy
strides until he came to the Saint Frère house. He
went in through the cellar window, turned and drew
Lisle in after him, then listened intently. There
was no sound anywhere. Then he struck the flint
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_255' id='Page_255'>255</a></span>
and tinder which he kept on a shelf near the window
and lit a lanthorn which he also kept on the shelf.
It was the same green lanthorn which Marie Josephine
had lit when she went down to the secret
cellar.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then Dian spoke to Lisle.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Little Master, I am taking you where you will
be safe. It is a place that Monsieur your grandfather
loved, and it was built by the Lisle Saint
Frère whom you have always loved to think about.
Come with me, and mind your steps well, for we
are going down a secret stairway into a hidden
room.” As he spoke, Dian led Lisle across the
cellar, and stooping at the seventh stone, pressed it
and it opened.</p>

<p class='c018'>Down, down into the gloom below them, the last
Lisle Saint Frère followed Dian the shepherd, down
to the cellar built by the first Lisle Saint Frère, deep
in the heart of the earth!</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_256' id='Page_256'>256</a></span>
  <h2 id='ch20' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter XX</span> <br /> <br />LISLE SEEKS ADVENTURE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Light from the green lanthorn and from two
candles on the shelf flickered on the tapestry in the
hidden cellar, bringing out unexpected gleams of
rose and blue in its faded grey weaving. At one end
of the long, strange room was a heap of rugs and
velvet draperies and some blankets and there was a
big tiger skin on the rough stone floor.</p>

<p class='c018'>A table covered with a crimson brocaded cloth
stood near the chest. Dian had found some boards
in the upper cellar and had thrown them down the
secret slide. With these he had made the table and
he was now making a sort of bed. He was stooping
over his work, his red locks falling about his shoulders,
his chisel and wooden nails beside him on the
floor. Lisle sat on the chest watching him, his hands
clasped about his knees. It was five days since Dian
had rescued him from the baker’s shop. At first he
had not been able to take an interest in anything
except the facts that the shepherd had told him that
first day, when they were safe in the hidden cellar,
that his mother was a prisoner in the house of his
Great-aunt Hortense, that the old lady herself had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_257' id='Page_257'>257</a></span>
died, and that Rosanne was safe with Humphrey
Trail, who had rescued her the night that Lisle had
been abducted.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle had slept in a sort of stupor all the next day,
rousing only to take the soup or milk which Dian
fed him. He had muttered about a cake with spun
sugar, and a mouse. Toward evening he had become
himself again, eager to hear all that Dian had
to tell him, and plying the shepherd with questions.
Les Vignes—was all going well there? Marie Josephine,
was she happy? Had they endured the
winter without discomfort? Dian had answered all
as best he could. He had told of Neville’s arrival
in disguise and of the expected arrival of a messenger
from the comtesse who never came. He told
of the long winter evenings around Mother Barbette’s
fire, and of how it had come to him, as he
crossed the meadow one night, that he should go to
Paris. He did not dwell too much on the danger
they all were in, but Lisle seemed to grasp it.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You see, I’ve known the danger all winter, Dian.
I’ve known it was there since the Tuileries were
taken. I’ve known it all along since then. We must
not stay here in this hidden room. We must be up
and out!” he had said impulsively.</p>

<p class='c018'>That was the night after the rescue, and now the
fifth day had come. Dian left him at intervals,
bringing back food for them both. He shook his
head when Lisle spoke of wanting to accompany
him.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_258' id='Page_258'>258</a></span>
“You shouldn’t run all the danger yourself, Dian.
You risked your life for me. Don’t you see I’m
strong now and ready to help? It’s my place to help
you, to save mother and get her and Rosanne out of
Paris. That was what was so awful about being in
the baker’s shop, not doing anything, not being able
to help,” he said, but Dian only shook his head as
he rose from his work.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s lonely for you here and it’s dark and gloomy,
too, but you are safe here and that is what counts
the most. Never fear but your time will come to
help. You’re helping now just by staying here.
Your mother will be saved and she and Mademoiselle
de Soigné will get safe out of Paris,” Dian
answered.</p>

<p class='c018'>“How do you know? How can you tell, Dian?”
Lisle jumped up and came and stood in front of the
shepherd, who looked up from his work.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I can not tell you how I know, Little Master. I
knew that I or the good Humphrey would find you,”
and then Dian told again about discovering the note
in the cake at the spinner’s supper. Lisle loved to
hear the story.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It was wonderful,” he said slowly as Dian
finished speaking and went on with his work. Then
Lisle hesitated. It was not easy for him to show
emotion or sentiment of any kind. He put his hand
on Dian’s shoulder as he bent over the boards with
his saw. “There is no one like you, Dian,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>The shepherd had waited for questions about the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_259' id='Page_259'>259</a></span>
hidden cellar. It had amazed him that Lisle had
not seemed to be surprised about it, but he was soon
to know why. Lisle walked up and down for a time
after he spoke to Dian. He rubbed his hand along
the rough stone wall, lifted a corner of the tapestry
curtain, and said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is very old, isn’t it, Dian?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Very old, Little Master,” Dian replied.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Did my grandfather know about it?” was Lisle’s
next question.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He knew and he told me,” came the shepherd’s
answer.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Why did he not tell me, too?” demanded Lisle,
and as he spoke he came back to the chest and sat
down, looking eagerly across at Dian, his light brows
drawn together in the frown that with him generally
meant trouble.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian stood up, straightening his great height.
Then he walked slowly up and down the room, his
hands locked in front of him, thinking deeply. When
at last he answered Lisle he spoke slowly. “It is
hard to tell you why, and I do not really know myself,
except that it was always the Little Mademoiselle
whom your grandfather thought the most
about, and it was to her that he told the secret of
the cellar. It is no longer a secret, and the time
has come when it may shelter you all.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle was standing in front of him, his eyes flashing
blue fire.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He told Marie Josephine, that baby, told her
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_260' id='Page_260'>260</a></span>
instead of me who am head of my house, now that
he has gone. What can you mean, Dian, when you
say that grandfather told Marie Josephine?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian was reaching for his cloak which hung on a
nail at one side of the secret stairs as he answered
quietly:</p>

<p class='c018'>“The Comte Saint Frère thought that it was for
the best. He said that the Little Mademoiselle was
the one of you who thought the most, the one who
cared for everyone and everything.” Dian turned
and faced Lisle as he went on, speaking tenderly.
“It was not indeed that you were not his dear beloved
grandson. He had many hopes and dreams
for you, only the Little Mademoiselle dreamed, too.
She was different.”</p>

<p class='c018'>As he spoke, Dian climbed the first step of the
stairs. “I’ll be gone but a short time and we’ll have
a good talk about it all when I come back,” he
said, and then he climbed up the stairs, opened the
secret panel, and, after sliding it back in place, went
out through the cellar into the soft spring dusk. He
was sad at heart, for he knew that Lisle was wounded
in his pride, and that he was angry. It would not
make things easier to have him so. He knew that
it would be as well to leave him alone for a time,
and he felt that it was the hour for him to pay a
visit to Vivi and Rosanne. More and more the conviction
grew upon him that Rosanne’s situation was
now becoming perilous, and that he must soon, at
all costs, see that she was safely hidden in the secret
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_261' id='Page_261'>261</a></span>
cellar, until such time as he could effect an escape for
the comtesse.</p>

<p class='c018'>He had seen Humphrey and had told him of
Lisle’s escape and of his being safe in the hidden
cellar. He knew that he had done well in telling
Humphrey of the cellar, and one of the things he
had decided to do next was to show it to him and to
tell him of the secret panel and how to open it.
Humphrey did not seem to realize his own danger,
but Dian felt that it was there. Humphrey was an
alien enemy of the Republic. His safety so far had
lain largely in the fact of his being so typically a
farmer.</p>

<p class='c018'>Surveillance was growing daily more strict. At
any time both Humphrey and Rosanne might be
discovered. Dian was thinking of all this as he
walked through the crowded, unruly city, amid the
sound of hammers on anvils and the rumble of tumbrils
carrying poor victims to the guillotine.</p>

<p class='c018'>As he walked, his cloak thrown across his
shoulders, his long even strides taking him over the
ground in good time, he was thinking deeply, but he
was in no way discouraged. He was right when he
said to Lisle that he had deep faith in the safety of
them all, but it was something that he could not
put into words, something deep within him which
spoke to him of good, and which gave him confidence.
He turned to it as simply as a child, and it
had never failed him. He had thought a great deal
about Vivi while he had been in the hidden cellar
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_262' id='Page_262'>262</a></span>
the last few days. He knew that there was very
much that he could do for her, poor little ignorant
child, so kind of thought and action, so ready
to do as they asked her, keeping their secret for
them. There was a life of sunshine for Vivi, away
from the dirty alley and the rough madness of Paris,
of that Dian was sure, and for that he would work.</p>

<p class='c018'>He walked to the west gate and stood in the dusk,
exchanging greetings with the soldiers on guard and
with various vendors of hot soup, eau sucré, and
coffee. Then he went on toward the Saint Antoine
district, finding himself at last in the dingy alley
where lived three people in whom he was deeply
interested and whom he loved.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanne overwhelmed him with questions. Her
joy in the thought of Lisle’s safety made her almost
like the happy girl who used to ride up and down the
long driveway at Les Vignes.</p>

<p class='c018'>“If only you could stay and tell us all about the
hidden cellar!” she said as Dian came in bringing
something almost like sunshine with him.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey Trail was as interested as Rosanne.
His honest face glowed with pleasure when Dian
said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“The Little Master talked and talked of you,
Humphrey. As soon as he knew about his mother
and Mademoiselle he began to talk of you. 'Humphrey
Trail is my friend. He saved Rosanne and
he gave me good counsel which I was too proud to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_263' id='Page_263'>263</a></span>
take. Dian, I want to show that I am his friend,
too,’ he said.”</p>
<hr class='c022' />
<p class='c018'>Dian took a piece of paper from his pocket and
read what was written on it.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a copy of the note to Grigge which Raoul
had taken through the gates. It read:</p>

<p class='c018'>“When this reaches you, aid Champar to do all
that may be needful for the family at Les Vignes.
Go with Champar in the coach to Calais, and give
this note which is inclosed to one Anastasius Grubb,
who is skipper of a fishing smack called the <i>Sandlass</i>.
He is thick set, and has a black beard, and has a
scar over his left eye. Deliver the note into his
hands and into no other’s. I trust you. I know
that you will be guided. Consult Champar the
coach driver in case of danger. Dian.”</p>

<p class='c018'>What would those who trusted him say if they
knew that he had sent this important note to the
miserable boy who lived in a hovel at the gates of
Les Vignes? Dian, in his wisdom, knew that he had
done well. He had spent many a night in Pigeon
Valley, when his eyes were blurred with weariness,
teaching Grigge to read and write. He had kept
up the boy’s courage when he had been in despair,
and had given him a hold on life. He had strengthened
his love for young and helpless animals. He
trusted him now to do this one great service.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The little Vivi is late. It is best that I go and
find her,” Dian said, and as he spoke, he tore up
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_264' id='Page_264'>264</a></span>
the copy of the letter, and threw it into the fire.
Then he went out, leaving Humphrey and Rosanne
to their simple supper of bread and greens. Dian
wanted a word alone with Vivi.</p>

<p class='c018'>He went to the West Barricade and stood watching
the carts go through. He knew several of the
soldiers who stood about and he nodded to Georges
Fardou, who was on guard at the gate, and with
whom he often had a word. He was about to turn
away when two figures came flying through the
gates, a girl and a boy! They stood still for a
second, as though dazed. The next instant they
threw themselves upon Dian.</p>

<p class='c018'>Fardou gave a gruff laugh, exclaiming, “Look
here, young Vivi. There will be no more of this
going in and out of the gates. You and your young
tramp of a friend can keep inside. You’d never
have gotten through to-day if I’d been on guard.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian never knew how he passed the next few
minutes. His Little Mademoiselle, the wildest, dirtiest
little vagabond imaginable, was hugging him,
whispering through soft sobs, “Dian, Dian, Dian.”
Jean Barbette, a dusty, smutty-nosed boy, if ever
there was one, held tight to his hand, fairly jumping
for joy. Dian felt his heart give a great leap when
he heard the guard call out “Vivi.” He himself had
thought at first that Marie Josephine was Vivi.
There was safety in this, beyond words to measure!</p>

<p class='c018'>He took them each by the hand, saying over his
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_265' id='Page_265'>265</a></span>
shoulder to Fardou, “I’ll see that they stay where
they belong!”</p>

<p class='c018'>He walked with them quickly down a side street
toward the alley.</p>
<hr class='c022' />
<p class='c018'>Lisle had sat still on the chest for some time after
Dian left him. He looked at the quiet dusk of the
old place, at the flicker of light from the green
lanthorn, at the weird figures on the tapestry. He
was angry, for his pride had been hurt, his sorest
point. Grandfather had told Marie Josephine about
the cellar instead of him, had told a mere child
who could know little or nothing of what it meant.</p>

<p class='c018'>He would show them that he was no child to be
kept in hiding! Dian had said that it was necessary
that he stay in the cellar for the present, and had
taken it for granted that he would do so, but he had
not given Dian his word that he would stay. As he
climbed up the secret stairs he was glad that this
was so. He had watched Dian open the panel and
when he reached the top of the stairs he did as the
shepherd had done, and to his joy the panel slipped
out easily. What would Marie Josephine say if she
could see him now!</p>

<p class='c018'>He slipped the panel back in place, and stood for
a moment in the dim cellar, the musty scent of apples
and onions all about him. He thought of the night
when he had come down for wood, leaving Rosanne
singing in the salon, and of all that he had been
through since then. He turned back toward the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_266' id='Page_266'>266</a></span>
secret panel, hesitated, then ran quickly up the dark
stairway to the floor above.</p>

<p class='c018'>He was in his own house! He was master of
that house! It had belonged to his forefathers
and now it was his own, but as he went into the
great, silent hall, he knew that he was not quite as
he had been that night of the blizzard when he had
toasted nuts with Rosanne. He had known grave
danger and he had met with kindness. He had a
feeling of gratitude for the bakery woman. He
was sorry that all the pride and delight she had in
her cakes had ended in the shattering of her shop.
He felt an intense relief and thankfulness that
Rosanne was not in danger and he wanted to get
her safely out of Paris. Above all, he wanted to
set his mother free. That was one of his plans, to
go to Great-aunt Hortense’s house in some disguise.
He was full of plans and longing for action, but out
of all that he had learned these last weeks, he had
not lost his pride. He had not been content to wait
for Dian’s own good time. He had chosen a time
himself.</p>

<p class='c018'>As he stood there in the dark hall, he thought he
saw something move, and then decided that it was
only the swaying of the velvet curtain leading into
the salon. He put one foot on the stairs leading
to the floor above and then paused, listening. He
heard footsteps; they came from the direction of
the cellars. He was not mistaken. It must be Dian
who had come back through the cellar window.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_267' id='Page_267'>267</a></span>
The hot blood mounted to Lisle’s face. Dian had
found that he was gone and was coming to look for
him. He turned and looked back, and at that
moment saw the tall figure of the shepherd in the
half light. He was just about to speak to him when
some one crouching by the velvet curtain jumped
forward, and pointed a gun at Dian’s head.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle ran out of the shadow and threw himself
in front of the shepherd, both arms outstretched.
The gun fell to the floor with a crash and its owner
began to sob. It was Henri!</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_268' id='Page_268'>268</a></span>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter XXI</span> <br /> <br />IN THE HIDDEN CELLAR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The three of them stood there in the great, dark
entrance hall, Henri trying to speak through his
sobs.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You, Monsieur Lisle! You are safe. I can not
believe my eyes. I am glad, glad! You can not
know—I was tempted. I was weak. They talked
me over, Tortot and his friend, and they promised
me a big reward, but I have known nothing but
misery. Monsieur Lisle, you must believe me. I
have known only horror since I helped them plan
to take you away, and since the imprisonment of
Madame, your mother, at the home of your aunt.”
Henri clasped his hands in his earnestness. “I am
in despair. I have known bad hours in this house.
They have turned against me, Tortot and the others.
They say that I am working against them. I
thought just now that one of them had come to kill
me. I promise now to do all I can to help you and
yours.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle’s face showed no signs of softening as he
stood there facing Henri. He was full of excitement.
He had come from the hidden cellar, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_269' id='Page_269'>269</a></span>
had found adventure before he reached the second
story. He had no pity for Henri.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You saw to it that my mother was made a
prisoner, and yet you dare to whine before me,”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian had stood silent during the words between
Henri and Lisle. He saw what Lisle did not see,
that Henri’s repentance was real, and that, in spite
of his weakness and cowardice, Henri wanted now,
most earnestly, to atone! It was a blessed thing
for them all, that Dian knew this to be true. Henri
was one of the people and he knew Paris well.
Henri turned to Dian.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell the young master that it is so. Do not be
mad enough to refuse my aid. I have joined up
with a battalion and am leaving the city shortly.
I did not mean them any real harm, only I was
afraid——”</p>

<p class='c018'>“You need not give your cowardice as an excuse.
It is you and those like you who are making this
revolution a thing for fiends. It is you and your
kind who are taking all the beauty from the thought
of brotherhood. The Saint Frères have not shown
you any kindness, you will say, and that may be true;
but they trusted you, a woman and two children,
alone and unprotected. They never did anything to
deserve such rank disloyalty.” Dian spoke very
sternly and turned in the next breath and addressed
himself to Lisle. “You, too, are untrustworthy and
disloyal,” he said, and looked straight into Lisle’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_270' id='Page_270'>270</a></span>
eyes. Lisle’s eyes answered his, a world of grieved
astonishment in their depths.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian turned again to Henri.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Prove your words by some deed that will show
you to be less a coward. I trust you now. I am
taking this boy where he will be kept in safety. You,
in the meantime, can try to find some way to undo
your evil work. I can come and go by way of the
broken window in the cellar. You know it well. I
can receive a message from you if you have anything
of import to tell me.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Henri came nearer to Dian as he spoke, looking
at him in a way he had never looked at any human
being before. It was as though he were seeing himself
for the first time. He put out both his hands
toward Dian.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You trust me?” he faltered.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian nodded. Then he turned and drew Lisle
close to him. He knew that he had spoken harshly.
He had meant to do so.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He saved your life, for I might have killed you!”
Henri said to Dian and the shepherd answered:</p>

<p class='c018'>“He is like that first Lisle Saint Frère, his long-ago
ancestor.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian turned away after he had said these words.
Then looking back at Henri, he went on, “Leave
any message for me, here in this hall, under the carpet
by the stairs.” He went on down the hall, Lisle
beside him. When they reached the cellar stairs
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_271' id='Page_271'>271</a></span>
he looked back. There was no sign or sound of
any one. Henri was not following, not spying.</p>

<p class='c018'>When they reached the first cellar, they stood
for a moment by the jam shelf where the swinging
lanthorn cast its light upon them. Lisle caught hold
of Dian’s arm and looked up at him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You said I was like the first Lisle Saint Frère.
You said it after I had disobeyed you. I’m sorry
that I left the cellar when you trusted me to stay,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian held him at arm’s length, smiling the smile
that seemed to transfigure him, bringing a radiance
to his face.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, you did wrong. We all do. It is true that
you are like the first Lisle. Listen, my child, there
are great things for you to know. Awake to them!
Think of the protection that has been with you and
yours. You will see.” As he spoke, Dian went to
the panel, and kneeling, opened it. It slid back
and they descended backward into the depths.</p>

<p class='c018'>As Lisle reached the last step, his first impression
was of light, and when he turned around, a blaze
of candle radiance greeted him. He put his hand
to his forehead, leaning back for a moment against
the rough wall.</p>

<p class='c018'>The lighted cellar seemed unreal and so did the
two figures who stood by the old, carved chest. One
of the figures, with an odd cry that was half a laugh,
half a sob, sprang forward and caught him about
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_272' id='Page_272'>272</a></span>
the neck. She was a wild-looking, dark child with
rough black locks which flapped against his face
as she clung to him, but in spite of her rags and the
strangeness of her appearance, he knew, when she
called his name, that it was Marie Josephine!</p>

<p class='c018'>He was bewildered and it was not to be wondered
at. After weeks of inaction in the bakery shop,
the sudden wild rescue, the hidden cellar, leaving
it, the episode with Henri in the hall, and now,
wonder of wonders his sister, Marie Josephine! He
felt her arms clinging to him and looking over her
shoulder he saw—could he believe his senses?—little
Jean Barbette, covered with dust and smiling out
of his black eyes!</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is Jean!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean was so delighted at Lisle’s surprise, that he
began to hop about on one foot. “Yes, I came! I
came all the way from Pigeon Valley to Paris!
I’m going to tell Petite Mère all about it!” Jean’s
eyes seemed fairly to blaze in his excitement.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Let us go over to the chest and sit down!” said
Lisle, who was trying not to show his emotion and
his unbounded surprise, but he failed in this, for they
could all see that he was fairly dazed. He sat down
on the chest with Marie Josephine beside him, and
in spite of her dust and grime, he kept his arm close
about her. Then he beckoned to Jean. “Come and
sit on the other side, won’t you, Jean?” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian had gone over to the heap of rugs, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_273' id='Page_273'>273</a></span>
coming back with a soft brown one, put it on the
floor in front of the chest. Jean sat down on it
with his legs crosswise.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You sit down between us on the chest, Dian,”
suggested Marie Josephine excitedly. “We can
talk and talk but I don’t know where to begin.
There are so many things I want to tell and to
hear about!”</p>

<p class='c018'>It was true. It was all so strange and unreal,
the journey, their coming through the gates meeting
Dian, then the alley, an odd dark room, a funny
fat man, whose name was Humphrey Trail and who
was Lisle’s friend, and with him Rosanne! Then
the walk through the noisy streets with Dian to her
own home, to the secret cellar!</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine had to be the one to talk first.
She talked so fast and said so much that her words
fairly tumbled over themselves, but her hearers were
so interested that they did not miss one of them!
Jean sat listening as eagerly as any one, nodding
his head vigorously every now and then, and blushing
at Marie Josephine’s praise of him. They
drank in all she had to tell them of that spring
night less than a week ago when she had dressed
herself in the disguise which she had been all winter
in procuring, and which she told them would furnish
a story all of itself. She told of the pitiful whine
of Flambeau when she had come away and left him,
of the last glimpse of Mother Barbette’s cottage,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_274' id='Page_274'>274</a></span>
and then of her words to Grigge. She told of the
run through the sweet, night air of their dear Pigeon
Valley, and finally of finding Jean just behind her!</p>

<p class='c018'>When she reached this stage in her narrative she
stopped for sheer lack of breath and Dian stood
up, saying:</p>

<p class='c018'>“You both need food, Little Mademoiselle. I
shall prepare it.”</p>

<p class='c018'>At these words of Dian’s Jean cried, “Bravo!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine gave a happy little laugh. “Yes,
we do, and I’ll stop talking altogether for a few
minutes.” She turned toward her brother as she
spoke. He was sitting with his head thrown back
against the grey stone wall, his hands at his sides.
He wore one of the dark velvet suits which brought
back memories of the schoolroom. Dian had found
it upstairs and had brought it down to him. Marie
Josephine had only been told that Lisle was safe in
the hidden cellar. She knew nothing of the baker
shop. As she turned to look at him, he smiled back
at her, the first time since he had smiled at the
bakery woman over the cake. He was so astounded
at what she had done, that he could scarcely believe
it was not all a dream. What was it Dian
had said there by the panel, that wonderful smile
on his face?—“think of the protection that has been
with you.” Marie Josephine and Jean had come
safely through to the heart of Paris. His sister
was sitting there beside him in a disguise which she
had thought of and carried out herself. She had
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_275' id='Page_275'>275</a></span>
known high adventure, and she told it all simply as
an interesting story, without a trace of vainglory.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Why did you come, Marie Josephine? Was it
because of the hidden cellar?” Lisle asked her,
and Dian, as he bent over his cooking in a far corner
of the room, listened for her reply. He had built
a small fire in a rough hollow of the floor and he was
brewing chocolate. The fire made some smoke but
not enough to cause discomfort, drifting off into the
dim recesses of the alcoves beyond.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I came because of knowing about it, partly because
of that and partly because grandfather had
told me that I was to tell about it if it were to save
a life. I thought and thought about it all winter.
It seemed as though the spring would never come.
I knew no one would dream of letting me come, of
course, and I didn’t tell any one but Jean about
what I was going to do. If you want me to I’ll go
right on telling some more while we have the chocolate.
There is so much to tell!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian took off the red, brocaded cloth and brought
out a white one from a shelf in a sort of small cavern
in the wall. He spread it on the table. Marie
Josephine jumped up, breaking off with, “I’ll set
the table. I can talk while I’m doing it. Bring
the silver, and the horn drinking cups, Jean. They’re
there on the shelf. You see,” she looked across
and smiled at Jean as she spoke, “I—I’ve been here
in the hidden cellar before!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle was still sitting with his head thrown back
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_276' id='Page_276'>276</a></span>
against the stone wall, and as Marie Josephine
looked over at him, a drinking cup in one hand and
a silver spoon in the other, she noticed suddenly
that his face was very white there in the candlelight
and that there was something different about it. It
was always like him to keep things to himself. She
came across to him slowly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You have been always in my thoughts, and that
is why I came—because of maman and of you. She
is safe at Great-aunt Hortense’s house and Dian
will take care of us, but there is something that
makes you different. What is it?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian brought a loaf of bread on a blue plate and
put it on the table. He had already placed a dish
of cheese by the jug of chocolate. Then lifting the
table, he brought it up close to the chest.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Come and eat and drink. That is the best for
now. There is much to tell on each side, for you
are not the only one who has had adventures, Little
Mademoiselle,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, yes, I know; Rosanne. I am thinking all
the time about it, how Humphrey Trail carried her
through the snowstorm to that funny dark alley
room.” She looked across uncertainly at Lisle.
“There is something I do not know, something you
have not told me,” she said slowly.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle stood up and caught her about the waist.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Come,” he said, “you are the worst little beggar
as to looks I’ve ever beheld, isn’t she, Dian? But
we’d rather have her just as she is than the greatest
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_277' id='Page_277'>277</a></span>
beauty in Paris as it was in the good old days!”
He bowed before her as he spoke and, to his surprise,
she started the first steps of the minuet. How
she blessed those hours after dinner, practicing with
Bertran! She hummed the melody as she danced
and she forgot everything, even the hot chocolate
for the moment. It was Lisle, with his same old
half-laughing, half-serious way. She was dancing
with him in the secret cellar and, of all the strange
happenings of the past week, this seemed the strangest
and in all ways the most wonderful.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Sometime I’ll tell you about a mouse,” he said
as they went through the graceful measures.</p>

<p class='c018'>“A mouse! What do you mean?” she questioned
merrily, smiling over her shoulder at Dian and Jean.</p>

<p class='c018'>“And a cake!” he went on.</p>

<p class='c018'>“A cake! What do you mean?” she exclaimed
again.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Come, please, and have the very nice chocolate,”
pleaded Jean, and they both came running up to the
table.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a strange supper there in the deep dim
cavern in the heart of the earth. Lisle and Jean
brought the bed up to the table, and they sat down
on it, opposite Dian and Marie Josephine. The
hot chocolate in the old horn drinking cups was
delicious, and it seemed to the two wayfarers that
they had never tasted anything so good as the bread
and cheese.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell me what you mean by a mouse and a cake,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_278' id='Page_278'>278</a></span>
Lisle,” Marie Josephine demanded, but her brother
shook his head.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m too hungry just now, and I want to know
what happened when you found that Jean had followed
you. That’s where you left off in your story,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian had told Marie Josephine that the good
Yorkshire farmer had saved Rosanne from men
who had tried to abduct her. He had told her at
once that Lisle was safe in the hidden cellar and
that her mother was in the house of Great-aunt
Hortense, but more than this she did not know. She
had taken for granted, in her fatigue and excitement,
that her mother was quite safe, being in the
house of her great-aunt, and as Lisle sat before
her alive and well she could not but see that it was
all right with him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“When I knew that Jean had really come, had
followed me all the way, I was so glad! I can’t
tell you how I felt, but it was like flying. We ran
on and on through the woods, and we did not seem
to be tired at all. We would rest now and then,
and once I told a story, but I didn’t dare to stay
still for very long, for fear Jean would fall asleep.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean blushed at this, and Marie Josephine added
hastily:</p>

<p class='c018'>“It was hard for me to keep awake, too, for
everything was asleep, even the owls, I think. It was
wonderful, wasn’t it, Jean, there in the still night?
I’d always wanted to be out in the woods in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_279' id='Page_279'>279</a></span>
middle of the night, not just evening. When early
morning came we were at the edge of the forest,
and we went right up to the old green mill-inn!”
Marie Josephine leaned forward eagerly as she
went on, one hand stretched across the table: “The
minute I saw the dark woman, I recognized her as
the one who waited on us at lunch last summer, but
of course I wasn’t a bit frightened because she
thought we were just little tramp children. She was
just going to tell us to be off when—what do you
think?” She paused impressively.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What!” exclaimed Lisle.</p>

<p class='c018'>He was listening eagerly, a bit of color in his
cheeks. Dian watched him, wondering if the first
Lisle Saint Frère had been like him. Dian, too, was
listening with all his heart to everything that Marie
Josephine was saying.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Why, all of a sudden, who should appear at
the edge of the forest and come running to us but
Flambeau!”</p>

<p class='c018'>They all laughed at this statement, but their
laughter sounded so odd, echoing through the long,
low hollows and arches of the ancient place that they
stopped almost as soon as they began, and Marie
Josephine went on with her story. She told how
the woman suddenly became very friendly and ushered
them inside, how she became suspicious of the
woman, and how Jean tried the door and found it
bolted.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I couldn’t be really sure it was the same woman
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_280' id='Page_280'>280</a></span>
I’d seen under our oak at Les Vignes, but I was
almost sure, and I knew when we found that we
were locked in.” They listened breathlessly while
she told of the eave’s trough and their escape.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You talk for a while, Jean. Tell them the rest.
Jean was so splendid. It was all his idea about the
trough and the tree.” Marie Josephine sat back
and rubbed her eyes, which smarted a little from the
smoke of the fast-dying fire.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian sat with his hands on his knees, his face
almost stern in its earnestness. The woman from the
green mill had been spying. He had always felt that
it was a strange place, and so had Neville, though
they had had no real reason to suspect it. He hoped
with all his heart that the adventure of the green
mill had been only an episode in the children’s
strange journey, and that there would not be anything
further to fear from that direction.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean told of the happy meeting with the man
who drove the coach.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There isn’t much to tell about it, for we went
right to sleep and slept all day. The driver was
a very nice man, and when I woke up I went and
sat on the box with him, and we talked about all
that’s going on. He told me his brother was fighting
with the army of the Revolution. He was a kind
man even if he was cross-eyed.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“What was his name?” It was Dian who spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jean shook his head, and so did Marie Josephine.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I ought to remember but I don’t. A farm boy
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_281' id='Page_281'>281</a></span>
came up to the cart and gave him a letter to deliver
on his way back, just as we were getting out of the
cart. The boy spoke his name but I’ve forgotten
it,” answered Jean.</p>

<p class='c018'>A cross-eyed coach driver on the Calais road, a
farm boy with a note for him to deliver on his
way back. Dian bowed his head over his hands and
sat quietly. As Jean went on Dian knew what he
had so longed to know, that the note for Grigge
had fallen safely into the hands of Champar the
coach driver, who was his friend.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He asked him if he went near Pigeon Valley,
and the driver said, 'Yes, sometimes in good
weather,’ and that he was going that way on his
route back,” Jean said, thus giving Dian the knowledge
he so longed to possess.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Do go on and tell how we walked all night because
we had slept all day,” put in Marie Josephine
impatiently.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You tell, Little Mademoiselle,” said Jean.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It was the best time of all, I think, for though
we were thrilled the first night we were—well, not
frightened, but sort of not used to it all. We’d
had a splendid rest all day and we were so excited.
It was such a warm night, and the wild lavender was
so sweet that the whole wood smelt of it. It was
splendid out on the highroad, too, and we never met
anything to frighten us. We had the food we’d
both brought, and we ate it at dawn under a big
flowering hawthorn tree. We kept on walking,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_282' id='Page_282'>282</a></span>
and we didn’t know how tired we were, until all of
a sudden we couldn’t go another step. We went to
sleep in a sort of summer house in the garden of
an empty house. No one saw us, and in the afternoon
we started on.” Marie Josephine hesitated,
and then said honestly:</p>

<p class='c018'>“We were all tired out by that time and I was
very cross.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“It was my fault because I was homesick,” put in
Jean.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It wasn’t your fault any more than mine, for
we were both homesick and Flambeau was a great
worry.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Where is Flambeau?” asked Lisle.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We’ve left him with some people in a farmhouse.
We knew we simply couldn’t come through the gates
with him,” answered his sister.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The Little Mademoiselle was very good to me
when I was homesick on the third day. It was
while the sun was going down, and we were sitting
on a mound near a river where we could see it. It
made me think of how we used to watch it sinking
behind the woods when we used to come across the
meadow with Dian and the sheep, and—and—I
cried.” Poor Jean blushed as he admitted the last.</p>

<p class='c018'>“So did I almost. There were tears in my eyes,
and some you didn’t see slid right down my cheeks,
Jean. It was glorious, sitting there by the river,
watching the sun say good-by to it, making it all
gold and pink. I told Jean about the 'Song of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_283' id='Page_283'>283</a></span>
Roland’ and we pretended to listen for his horn
echoing down from the hills, just the way it must
have sounded to the soldiers long ago when Roland
blew the last blast as he was dying in the hills.
The next day we had a long ride in a farmer’s cart.
He was a fierce man with bristling moustaches even
though he was a farmer. He said he hoped the
guillotine would put an end to every aristo in the
country. That ride helped a good deal, and when
the farmer asked if we were hungry and we said
we were, he gave us some young radishes and a
half loaf of bread.” Marie Josephine stopped for
a moment to draw a long breath, and then said regretfully:
“We didn’t really have any exciting
adventure except the one of the old green mill. We
just trudged along and everyone took us for poor
tramp children, though they all stared and asked
questions about Flambeau. That was one reason
why we left him with some nice children who lived
in a house near Melon. They promised to take
good care of him until we came for him, and to keep
him locked up until we were out of sight so he could
not follow us. I knew that Flambeau would make
it much harder for us when we came to Paris, he
looks so——”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Such an aristo,” suggested Lisle.</p>

<p class='c018'>They all laughed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“That’s it,” assented his sister. “He’s such an
aristo.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian stood up suddenly, and going over to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_284' id='Page_284'>284</a></span>
stairs, listened. Then he started back a little, putting
his hand out warningly toward the children. The
next instant a breathless voice came down to them:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tha said well when tha said the sliding was not
large; an’ I live to reach the cellar I shall never
come back again!”</p>

<p class='c018'>They all ran eagerly to the foot of the stairs.
There, coming down backward, was Humphrey
Trail and in front of him, moving cautiously, her
hand on his shoulders, was Rosanne. Dian was
up the stairs and had shut the panel in a second.
Then he waited a few minutes, listening. When he
returned Humphrey was surrounded by the children.
Jean sat on his knee, Marie Josephine stood on one
side, Rosanne next her, the two friends holding
hands, and in front of him stood Lisle. Lisle was
speaking and Marie Josephine was more surprised
at his words than at the arrival of the farmer and
Rosanne.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Humphrey Trail, I am glad to see you. Humphrey
Trail, you were right and I was wrong. I
did not take your warning. I kept on going to the
baker’s shop until it became my prison. I brought
Rosanne into awful danger and you rescued her.
Humphrey, I—” He looked about the dim, bare
place, weird in the uncertain light of the fast melting
candles. “You are welcome here,” he ended
simply.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine never knew, she said afterward,
whether she was really awake, it all seemed so fantastic,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_285' id='Page_285'>285</a></span>
the half-dark cellar, all of them there together,
Lisle talking about a prison in a bakery shop,
and a note in a cake which Dian found at a spinner’s
supper. She heard over again of Humphrey’s wrapping
Rosanne in the blue velvet mantle, of his vain
search for Lisle, of his meeting at the gates with
Dian, of Vivi.</p>

<p class='c018'>They talked on, as Dian went through the dim,
rocky alcoves beyond, making beds out of rugs and
blankets and lighting candles, the striking of the
flint and tinder making an odd sound in the stillness.</p>

<p class='c018'>Vivi had come in late that evening and had
brought disquieting news. This Humphrey told
Dian in an aside. She had spent a good part of the
day roaming about, and had gone to the house of
the Marquise du Ganne. With other curious children
of the street, she had looked through the
broken door at the comtesse. She had heard that
there were other prisoners hidden in the house and
that in the course of a few days they were to be
taken to the prison of La Force. She had heard,
too, among the crowd that there was to be a general
search for missing aristocrats through the Saint
Antoine district. She had come in tired and excited,
after Humphrey had searched for her in vain and
had returned to the alley, and she had told him all
she knew. What he had not understood, Rosanne
had explained in English. They had thought it best
that Vivi should not know who they were, as much
for her own safety as for theirs; so, when they left,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_286' id='Page_286'>286</a></span>
Humphrey put a mound of coins on the table and
said to her: “Th’art faithful. We ha’ trust in tha.
I shall come back,” but he did not tell her where
they were all going.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rosanne had put her arms around her friend and
cried, and when Humphrey carried her out of the
door, she had said earnestly:</p>

<p class='c018'>“I, too, shall see you again. We are friends,
Vivi.”</p>

<p class='c018'>It was a grave risk that Humphrey ran, for there
was no friendly snowstorm to cover their getting
away, but the alley had been deserted and he had
concealed Rosanne completely with his cloak.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Dian, I wish we had brought Vivi with us. I
think all the time of Vivi,” Rosanne said as he
came up to her, a pillow for her bed and Marie
Josephine’s in his hands.</p>

<p class='c018'>The shepherd smiled.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You need not be afraid for the little Vivi, Mademoiselle.
She is safe in the only home she has ever
known, and there are bright days ahead for her.
She is better off now than she knows. Have no
thought for her but one of love.” He paused a
moment. “The good God who sent us Vivi loves
her, Mademoiselle,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine was half asleep, her funny,
tangled shock of hair on Rosanne’s shoulder, but
her eyes, when she looked up at Dian, were bright
with excitement.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I may go to maman to-morrow, promise me,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_287' id='Page_287'>287</a></span>
Dian. I told you in the alley room that I would be
patient about not seeing her to-night, but to-morrow
early I must go straight to her and to Great-aunt
Hortense. It will be quite safe for me in the streets
in my disguise.” She caught his arm and looked up
at him as she spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian looked down at Marie Josephine and said
to her simply:</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is real work for you to do to-morrow.
You have come just in time, and you have not come
in vain, Little Mademoiselle. I hope that you will
see your mother to-morrow.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c017'>Grigge unfastened the sheepfold gate and then
turned and faced Neville, who stood beside him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You’d better stop worrying about those who are
away, and keep your worry for those at home,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What do you mean by that, Grigge? There’s
no danger to Les Vignes. The trouble is all the
other way,” Neville answered, leaning back against
the grey paling. He was tired out and covered with
mud. He had just returned from a vain attempt to
find the runaways, and he was not eager to face
either the governess or Mother Barbette.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Things happen quickly these days. You can’t
tell what may happen next. Your fine friends up at
the house are none too safe. There were five fires
not so very far from here only last week. One of
the houses burned was the home of a friend of the
old man’s.” By “the old man,” Grigge meant
Marie Josephine’s grandfather.</p>

<p class='c018'>Neville’s face was white in the dancing sunshine.
He was not able to deny the truth of what Grigge
said, and he was thinking of the two lost children.
He did not know what to do.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_289' id='Page_289'>289</a></span>
“Dian should never have gone away. It would
be better, a thousand times better, to have Dian with
us,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge nodded. Here was one point on which he
thoroughly agreed with Neville.</p>

<p class='c018'>“That’s true! He shouldn’t have wasted his time
looking out for those that don’t deserve it. He’s
worth all of them put together!” he said. Then he
suddenly thought of the fight he had had with Jean,
and of how the Little Mademoiselle had cried out,
“What would Dian say!” As he stood there kicking
his heels against the wooden gate, Grigge knew
that he cared more about what Dian would say than
about anything else in the world, for Dian had
helped him to keep his hold on life, and to fight
despair. He had taught him to love the sun and
the stars, the flowers and the young animals. It
was easier to love these than to love people.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I rode like the wind and may have passed them
by. I dared not ask questions. I had a cup of
coffee at that old green mill-inn and I don’t like it.
The woman who waited on me asked questions. I
put her off, you can be sure of that. She knows
about what is going on here. She knows the Du
Mondes are here, and that old Martin and I are the
only men left to guard the place. When I rode
away she called after me: 'You must be lonely out
Pigeon Valley way, you and old Martin. You’ve a
pretty flock to look out for!’” Neville stopped
short and looked keenly at Grigge, who returned
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_290' id='Page_290'>290</a></span>
the look doggedly. “If I thought you’d done anything
tricky, you young good-for-nothing!” he exclaimed,
eyeing Grigge suspiciously. Grigge said
nothing, though he stuck his tongue out at him
impudently.</p>

<p class='c018'>Neville turned away. He was angry at himself
for having told Grigge, whom he heartily disliked,
anything about his worries. The boy’s voice followed
him: “You’d better keep your wits here at
home. Things are happening fast these days. One
day here, and the next gone.”</p>

<p class='c018'>When Neville left him, Grigge slouched back
against the gate, his hands in the pockets of his
brown shepherd’s smock. He looked less badly
nourished than in the wintertime. His gaunt face
was faintly brown from long days in the spring
meadows with his flock. There was little that he
really knew about what was going on in the country,
but he did know that there was turmoil in the towns
nearest them and that Les Vignes was in danger.
Neville was like the aristocrats, for he did not see
danger until it was fairly upon him. Grigge gleaned
every bit of information that he could from passing
peddlers, from farm men who came by, from everyone
who had anything to tell. There was no danger
for himself or his family, the rude huts along the
back road would be as safe as could be, but the great
house on the terrace was in grave peril, and those
who lived in it would not believe it!</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge turned on his heel and went out toward
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_291' id='Page_291'>291</a></span>
the highroad. As he reached the opening in the
hedge, he looked through and fairly gasped in astonishment.
The coach for Calais stood near the
gates! Grigge ducked through the hedge and came
up to it. The driver saw him and jumped down
from his high seat. The two stood facing each other,
the cross-eyed driver and Grigge. There was no one
else around.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I want to see a boy named Grigge Barbette on
urgent business!” said the coach driver at last.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m Grigge Barbette!” exclaimed Grigge, and
he was so excited that he caught hold of the man’s
arm. “What do you mean? Have you a message
for me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c018'>The coach driver eyed him sharply.</p>

<p class='c018'>“How am I to know that you really are Grigge
Barbette?” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge nodded toward the row of huts in the
distance.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Any one there will tell you,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c018'>The man looked at him a moment longer. Then
he put his hand in an inside pocket and drew out a
folded piece of paper sealed with a red seal.</p>

<p class='c018'>“This is for you,” said Champar. “There’s no
one I’d take all this fuss for but Dian the shepherd.
He knows, and I know, and the Lord above knows
I’d not be here on earth to-day but for him!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge tore open the note and read it. His long
face turned ashy white as he read. When he finished
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_292' id='Page_292'>292</a></span>
he looked up in a sort of daze at the coach driver,
who said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m here and I’ll do what’s best. I wonder if
they know up there at the house that it may not
be standing to-morrow night! I don’t care much
whether it is or not myself, or wouldn’t if Dian
didn’t set such store by it. Well, I’ll do what I can.
That’s what he wrote in the note. 'Do what you
can. Get the family at Les Vignes to some hiding
place near Calais if there is danger.’”</p>

<p class='c018'>Champar looked at Grigge, who returned his look
almost unseeingly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You mean there really is danger here?”</p>

<p class='c018'>The driver laughed gruffly as he replied:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Sans-culottes from Saulieu are out on the warpath.
They’ve been joined by former olive mill
workers down that way. They burned down the
château of the Comte d’Veraux night before last.
They have this place in mind. The people do not
love Les Vignes. Your own cousins are with the
rabble!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge stood with the note in his hand, looking
up at Champar.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He says to consult with you in case of danger,”
he gasped. It was more than for a moment he
could sense or understand. Here was word from
Dian. He was trusted to fulfill a mission—trusted!
Dian had chosen him. He had written, “I trust
you!” Whatever he did he would do like Champar,
for Dian’s sake!</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_293' id='Page_293'>293</a></span>
Why should he save the inhabitants at Les
Vignes? There was nothing that they had ever
done for him. Days of vengeance were at hand!
He stood still in the roadway, the letter clasped
tight in his hand.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You understand that if they are to get away it
must be at once. I can take them some of the way
at no great risk to myself. I will take them to a
barn near Calais. The shepherd, in his note to me,
says they must go there. He trusted these letters
to that farmer boy, Raoul. Well, the shepherd is
not afraid to trust! Come, we must go up to the
house. A coach driver has the chance to learn many
things, and I know the rabble have shouted the name
Saint Frère and Les Vignes. I know they will
come!” As he spoke, the coach driver took Grigge’s
arm.</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge never, as long as he lived, forgot those
few minutes there in the dusky twilight. He often
lived them over in the after years. He was fighting
with himself. At last he said, “I must go, too, for
I have a mission to look after in Calais. Come, we
will go to them.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The coach driver talked very fast as they went
through the woods. They must have some sort
of a disguise, all of them. They could wear the
servants’ clothes, and have, at least, the look of
decent farmer people. They must be made to understand
that they must come with them in order to
save their lives, and that they must do as they are
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_294' id='Page_294'>294</a></span>
told. This pleased Grigge very much! At least he
would show them that they were entirely at the
mercy of himself and the driver! They would do
as they were told!</p>

<p class='c018'>They found everyone out on the terrace, and
when Grigge and the driver approached, Bertran
and Denise ran to meet them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell us the news!” they cried.</p>

<p class='c018'>Cécile and Hortense, each with an arm about
the governess, came slowly down the terrace steps.
Their eyes were red with crying. It was nearly a
week since the children had gone, and there had
been no word of them.</p>

<p class='c018'>The coach driver did not bow, for he was a good
republican at heart, and in those days of the revolution
bowing had gone out of fashion. He was
doing this for the sake of a friend who had done
much for him, and he wanted them to understand
this.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Citizeness, you and your charges are in grave
danger. I hope you deserve the good chance for
your life which I am giving you. I have a note from
Dian, the shepherd, who is in Paris——”</p>

<p class='c018'>Madame Le Pont gave an exclamation, and
Denise ran up to the driver and caught his hand.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell me, did he speak of maman and Lisle, and
have you heard news of my little sister?” she cried.
Her hair fell in disorder about her tear-stained face
and her lips trembled.</p>

<p class='c018'>The driver shook his head. “I don’t know what
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_295' id='Page_295'>295</a></span>
you mean. I only know what I’m to do, and that is
in case of danger, to take you as near to Calais as I
dare; and that will be a good ways from the Calais
gates, I can tell you. I think something of my own
head and have no wish to have it chopped off by
Madame La Guillotine. Well, there’s danger right
enough. You must come with us at once. Have
you wits enough about you to rig yourselves up in
plain, decent, sensible farmer clothes? I often take
farmer folks into the towns. Hurry! You’ve no
time to lose. They are burning houses all along the
line and yours is on the list!”</p>

<p class='c018'>While the driver had been speaking they had all
gathered about him, too amazed to utter a sound.
When the governess started to protest, the driver
put up his hand.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are stupid, citizeness, and by your stupidity
may loose your own life and the lives of those in
your care. Get yourselves dressed at once. My
coach is in the highroad. We must start within an
hour. Every rod nearer to Calais means safety for
you, and just that much farther away from some of
your enemies.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll ride my horse,” said Bertran a little stupidly.
He was dazed by all that the man had said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You’ll do it if you want to lose your fine, black
head, but not otherwise, my young popinjay,” answered
the driver calmly.</p>

<p class='c018'>Cécile came up to him and spoke to him gently,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_296' id='Page_296'>296</a></span>
her eyes looking straight into his as she held out
her hand.</p>

<p class='c018'>“In spite of all you say, you are saving our lives,”
she said. “May I see the note from Dian? I know
his writing. We must be very sure, you understand,
at a time like this!”</p>

<p class='c018'>The driver put his hand inside his belt and drew
out his note from Dian. Cécile read it and then
addressed Madame le Pont.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It is from Dian. He says that we are in danger
and in an emergency this man is to help us. We are
to go to some hiding place near Calais and wait
there for help.” Cécile’s voice shook with excitement,
in spite of her outward calmness.</p>

<p class='c018'>The driver turned to Grigge.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The boy here will see to you after that. I have
to go straight to Calais and dare not be late. All
you can expect from me is the use of my coach as
far as I think it best to take you without too much
risk to myself. I’ll tell the shepherd where you are,
or get word to him safely, but be sure to understand
that it’s for his sake I’m doing this, and not yours!”</p>

<p class='c018'>There was no time to lose, the driver had said.
It seemed as though the minutes had wings. They
planned, discussed, rummaged in the servants’ old
apartments, found suitable clothes, and put them on.
Then they packed special valuables which Neville
buried in the ground. At last they were ready to
start. First they went through the woods to Mother
Barbette’s cottage. They had sent Grigge and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_297' id='Page_297'>297</a></span>
driver to beg her to go with them, but she insisted
that nothing could induce her to do so. She would
wait there for her naughty, darling Jean. The driver
told her she was right. “Nothing can happen to you
if you go to your cousins in the hovel,” he told her.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mother Barbette wept bitterly as she saw them
coming toward her through the clearing in the
woods. They did not seem at all funny to her in
their disguise, though at another time she would
have had a hearty laugh at Bertran in his farmer
boy’s smock, his hair flapping about his face, and
at the dignified Hortense in faded grey homespun,
her hair in stiff braids on each side of her ears. It
was no time for laughter. They were all tense and
white. The governess put her head on Mother
Barbette’s shoulder with a sob as she said good-by.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We will surely find the children and bring
them safely back with us when we come,” she said
brokenly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“They are safe. I’m sure of it, and I don’t worry
half as much as you think I do, Madame. I know
them both so well. They are so smart. I know my
Jean will come back to me, and I think that Dian
will bring him,” answered the simple soul bravely,
though the tears ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Dear Mother Barbette, this isn’t good-by. It’s
just au revoir. We will not rest until we find Marie
Josephine and Jean.” As she spoke, Cécile put her
arms around Mother Barbette and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_298' id='Page_298'>298</a></span>
The driver, who was really a kind-hearted soul,
cleared his throat.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The moon’s up and it’s time to start. No more
of this good-by business, or it’ll be good-by for
good,” he said, as they all stood at the cottage door,
the pine-filled air from the forest blowing about
them.</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge spoke to his aunt.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You’d best go to the hut and stay if there’s trouble.
You’ll be safe enough there,” he said, and he
did not sneer as was his wont. There was a dignity
about him that none of them had seen before. He
was risking his life for people whom he despised,
and he was doing it for the sake of a friend. Perhaps,
sometime, he would do the like for sheer love
of his brother man. At any rate, he had taken the
first step in that direction.</p>

<p class='c018'>They were off at last, all of them in the great
roomy coach, Bertran and Grigge sitting beside the
driver. The horses, after a good rest and feed,
went like the wind itself! It seemed as though they
knew that danger lay behind!</p>

<p class='c018'>The girls and the governess were tired and bewildered
and heartsick. They could think of nothing
but Marie Josephine. Finally, after they had
thought and said all that they could about the runaways,
Denise remarked:</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s so wonderful to think they dared to go to
Paris. The road is direct enough and Marie Josephine
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_299' id='Page_299'>299</a></span>
knows it well by coach, but little Jean knows
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I teased him once because he had never been anywhere,
and he said some day he was going to visit
his cousins near Melon,” said Bertran.</p>

<p class='c018'>The driver turned and looked at him. “Melon—let
me see—Melon. Why, I took in two children
the other day. They seemed dead beat out, and
slept all day in the back of the coach. The boy told
me, in the evening, that he had cousins near Melon!”</p>

<p class='c018'>The exclamations and the questions were so
numerous that Champar was sorry he had spoken.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Stop and tell us at once. We must know about
the children going to Melon,” they begged, but he
paid not the slightest attention to their entreaties
and only urged the horses to go faster. He intended
driving all night, and it was not until he stopped to
rest the horses before they took a hill, that he spoke
again at all.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Now just you listen to me, citizeness, and you
young people. You’ve got yourselves to think about
and you’re not going to help the young brats who’ve
run away by getting your heads snapped off by the
guillotine, which,” he went on, speaking impressively
and with something of a relish, “is what is happening
to most of your acquaintances, and serves them
right, too, some of them. Now, maybe the two I
picked up were the parties you’re talking about. The
boy certainly did look a great deal like the woman
you went to say good-by to at the cottage. A fine
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_300' id='Page_300'>300</a></span>
woman,” he went on meditatively, “a good, honest,
sensible woman. Well, I’ll tell you what I think,
and you needn’t have any fits about it. I think them
two parties is just as lively to-day as you are yourselves.
I think they’re in Paris, and I’ll get word
to the shepherd about them, too!” After he had
delivered this long speech, the driver picked up his
whip to go on when the governess spoke again.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Above everything we must find the little girl and
boy, you know,” she said, holding her odd striped
shawl drawn tightly about her shoulders. Her face
looked wan and pinched under her dark bonnet.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Above everything, citizeness, you ought to want
to save the necks of these children even though you
may not care a fig about your own,” Champar replied.
Then he began to sing a gruff doggerel,
drowning entirely Madame le Pont’s fervent reply.</p>

<p class='c018'>Toward dawn they slept for a few hours. In the
morning they stopped under a blooming apple tree
and ate some food. Champar seemed pleased with
the progress they were making and condescended to
sing them a song or two. People passed by in
farmer carts and waved a greeting. No one thought
it at all strange to see a farmer’s family having a
picnic under an apple tree.</p>

<p class='c018'>They were off again, their coach making a cloud
of dust behind them. All that day Champar and
Grigge talked earnestly together, ignoring Bertran
who sat beside them, and whom Grigge snubbed at
every occasion. It was decided that they were to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_301' id='Page_301'>301</a></span>
stay in a barn, back of a small farmhouse, which
had met with a fire the year before, and which belonged
to an uncle of Champar’s. The coach driver
would leave food with them on his way back from
Calais, and would report to Dian as to their whereabouts.
That was all that he could do, and it was
a risk at any cost, though the barn was in a lonely
bit of country near the sea, and quite the other way
from the main road to Calais.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was midnight before they saw the lights of
Calais and the first grey outline of the sea. Champar
knew his way well for he had often visited his
uncle. Sure enough there was the barn, grey, and
deserted by everything but rats! Champar and
Grigge and Bertran carried in the rugs and blankets
and enough food to last overnight. Then Grigge
turned to them all.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is a mission I have to do. I will come
again,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>There was a moment’s silence as they watched
the two climb up on the coach. Grigge turned and
spoke to them again. “You are to stay here until I
come,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We trust you, Grigge.” It was Cécile who
spoke, her lovely face very white in the starlight.</p>

<p class='c018'>They called their thanks after the coach driver.
Champar’s cross-eye leered at them over his shoulder.
He waved his hand.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Keep to yourselves, and keep an eye on that fat
boy or he will give you all away!” he called.</p>

  <h2 id='ch23' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter XXIII</span> <br /> <br />IN GREAT-AUNT HORTENSE’S HOUSE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“Was it while the bakery man was saying that
he would make you cry that you heard the noise
first, or just before?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Lisle said it was while the man was speaking
that he heard the noise first. You’re so excited,
Marie Josephine, you don’t listen to anything.” As
she spoke, Rosanne took a sip of the tea which Humphrey
had just brewed for them. “It’s so bitter,
Humphrey,” she said to him over her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c018'>The two girls sat on each side of Lisle on the
chest. It was the next day after they had come to
the cellar, and to Rosanne it was most bewildering
to be there in the dusk of the old place with her dear
Marie Josephine by her side.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey came up to them with a steaming jug.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Never tha mind if it’s bitter, lass, take th’ tea
and let it warm tha well.” As he spoke Humphrey
peered at Rosanne anxiously, his round face full of
concern. He had rescued her himself and had had
her in his care all these long weeks. Her face
seemed very white in the grey shadows of the hidden
cellar. Marie Josephine and Lisle held out their
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_303' id='Page_303'>303</a></span>
horn drinking cups for more tea, and then Humphrey
filled a cup for himself. He was a little
worried about his homespun traveling bag which
he had brought with him to Paris, and which Dian
was to bring when he came back from a visit to the
alley.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Sit here, Humphrey Trail; there’s room.” Lisle
shoved along the wide chest as he spoke and the
farmer sat down beside him. He had never heard
so much talk going on at one time before in his life.
It had seemed, since he had arrived the night before,
that everyone wanted to speak at the same time, and
that each one said the same things and asked the
same questions over and over. Marie Josephine
was saying for the third time, “I’m going to see
maman at Great-aunt Hortense’s to-day!” Well,
that was a task that had been left for Dian, telling
Marie Josephine that her mother was a prisoner and
that her aunt had died. Part of the telling Lisle
did at once.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Great-aunt Hortense died some weeks ago,
Marie Josephine,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>She looked at him, her black eyes wide with
astonishment. He was growing more used to her
wild, unkempt appearance, but he still grinned every
time he looked at her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Poor Great-aunt Hortense! How she must miss
everything! She did so love to be in it all, never
wanted to be left out of anything, even our children’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_304' id='Page_304'>304</a></span>
parties! Great-aunt Hortense gone—why—it makes
everything seem different!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Everything is different.” As he spoke, Lisle
stood up and went over to Humphrey, who had put
the cover on his precious little tin of tea. “I must
talk with you, Humphrey Trail.” he said, and drew
the farmer along to the far end of the room. “It’s
no use,” he went on, speaking in low tones, a precaution
entirely unnecessary, for the two girls were
deep in the account of their various adventures. “I
simply must get into a disguise and go out on to
the streets. I can’t stay here any longer, when my
mother is a prisoner!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey answered him: “Tha went out once
almost to tha death. Th’art a brave lad but tha
needs caution. Ha’ patience now until th’ shepherd
can best find a way for us all to help. He found
tha when I was fair distracted.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle put a hand on each of Humphrey’s shoulders
and smiled across at him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Humphrey Trail, Humphrey Trail!” he exclaimed.
“I am glad I have you for a friend. What
can we ever do for you, after all you have done for
us!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey’s answer surprised him beyond measure.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Be grateful for tha life and make thaself content
soon with the simple ways of the farm in Yorkshire!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle still stood with his hands on Humphrey’s
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_305' id='Page_305'>305</a></span>
shoulders, and as the farmer spoke he realized
suddenly their immediate peril. They were to leave
not only Paris but France, too, and Humphrey
Trail was offering them all he had to give in the
way of hospitality in England!</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle looked across at the girls, and then back at
Humphrey.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You mean we are to go to England. There is
so much to think about and to plan. I wish we
three, you, Dian, and I, could be alone so that we
could plan what’s best to do,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was just at that moment that the shepherd appeared,
coming down the secret stairs backward.
Marie Josephine and Rosanne jumped off the chest
and ran up to him. He stood in their midst with
his hands at his sides, looking about at all of them,
and for the first time since they had known him, all
of them felt that he, for the moment, was fighting
something that was trying to overpower him, and
that this something was fear! It was gone almost
as it came, his face cleared, and he smiled, putting
his hand on Marie Josephine’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is work for you, Little Mademoiselle,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle had come up to them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Let there be work for me, too, Dian,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian nodded. “Yes, work for each one of us so
that we may go safely out of this mad city, and that
you who are in danger may find refuge in England.”
As he spoke he took Marie Josephine’s hand and
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_306' id='Page_306'>306</a></span>
went on speaking, this time addressing himself
directly to Humphrey:</p>

<p class='c018'>“The servant Henri was genuine in his repentance.
He has offered practical help in one direction. I
will return with the Little Mademoiselle later in the
day.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle broke in impatiently: “What can Marie
Josephine do that I cannot do if I’m disguised
properly? Why should she take the risk while I am
here?” he protested.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian answered him quietly: “The Little Mademoiselle
will be safe. You came between me and a
gunshot last night. Help me once again by staying
here until I am ready.”</p>

<p class='c018'>He lifted Marie Josephine on to the first rung of
the tall ladder stairs and then started up after her.
The others watched them from below.</p>

<p class='c018'>When they had closed the secret panel, Dian
stood looking down at Marie Josephine, a world
of compassion in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Little Mademoiselle, you are like your grandfather.
Remember him to-day, for there is much
for you to do. Your mother is a prisoner in the
house of your Great-aunt Hortense who died some
weeks ago. She is in peril, but you can save her!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian had spoken the hard words quietly. It was
better to say them all at once, and not wait until the
time came to act. Her eyes met his bravely and her
answer was characteristic.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Lisle wants to be the one, poor Lisle!” she said.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_307' id='Page_307'>307</a></span>
“He cannot help at the moment. Now I will
tell you how you can aid in saving your mother. We
have all told you, indeed you know, that you came
so easily through the city gates because you are, in
your disguise, very much like the little Vivi, who is
Mademoiselle de Soigné’s friend. Vivi goes about
the city everywhere. She is known by soldiers, doormen,
street people, and their children. She sells
licorice water, as did her father, and she is popular
among the crowds. One of the men on guard at
the west gate is her especial friend, and Little Mademoiselle,
when you and Jean came through the gates
he thought you were Vivi and one of her chums. If
you will go to the house of the Marquise du Ganne
with Vivi’s licorice water tray, and sell your wares
among the crowds who daily throng the lower halls,
you can help to save your mother!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian sat down on an overturned barrel, and
Marie Josephine placed herself on the lowest step
of the cellar stairs.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Maman,” she murmured faintly. “I want to
see maman.” Tears brimmed in her eyes and fell
silently on to her shabby jacket. She brushed them
away with the back of her hand, and in spite of his
pity and love for her, Dian smiled. It was so like
her unconsciously to act her part. He waited with
his usual patience until she was quiet, then he said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Have we not always felt that things would come
right if we did not let in fear. All is going well for
us, and we can look beyond to-day as we did the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_308' id='Page_308'>308</a></span>
time we watched the storm from the terrace and
you were the first to see a gleam of gold through the
black clouds! Do not fear for your mother, only
have faith. Now listen well. Henri is not bad, only
weak, and he wants to make amends. He is now a
soldier of the army of the revolution, and he leaves
with his regiment at three o’clock to-day. He has
been on guard all the morning in the hall of your
great-aunt’s house. Food is always brought to your
mother at noon. Henri says that she is then left
entirely to herself until night. He has been on guard
during the week, and, as he has served in your great-aunt’s
house, he knows every corner of it.” Dian
paused a moment and then went on slowly: “He
knows of a small door on the first floor which leads
into the garden, and he has given me the key to this
door. People are not supposed to go to the upper
floor where your mother is imprisoned, but little Vivi
has been there several times. You know the house,
and the way to go down the back stairs. You are
Vivi from now on. She is safe at home, gladly staying
inside in order to help her friends. I will tell
you more as we walk along. Are you ready and
willing to go?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, as quickly as ever we can.” She jumped to
her feet and followed him up the cellar stairs. It
all seemed too unreal and strange to be true, as they
walked through the silent house and out of the door
into the garden, just as she and Rosanne had walked
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_309' id='Page_309'>309</a></span>
with Gonfleur that long ago—oh, so very long ago
it seemed—the night of the bal masqué!</p>

<p class='c018'>She and Dian mingled with the crowds going up
the Champs Élysées, turning off on the street that
led to the house of the Marquise du Ganne. They
walked slowly. No one noticed them, and, except
for an occasional greeting, no one spoke to them.
Dian had often walked about with Vivi, and he was
known to be a peasant from Brittany, which was
his original home.</p>

<p class='c018'>They could see the dark blur of the Bois against
the soft spring sky, and Dian welcomed the thought
that came to him. He had something to say to
Marie Josephine that was going to be difficult, and
he felt that it would be easier for her to hear it in
the sweet spring woods than on the crowded street,
so he suggested that they go on to the Bois and rest,
before they went to Great-aunt Hortense’s house.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is more that I have to tell you, Little
Mademoiselle,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>They sat down under a great elm, the tender
green tracery of leaves above them, the peace of
sunshine and warm earth all about them. Dian
turned toward Marie Josephine, his face alight with
earnestness.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Little Mademoiselle, you are ready to do brave
things, but I am asking you now to do one that will
be bravest of all. Champar, the coach driver, who
is my friend, is risking much to save you all.” Dian
looked off at the still, dim vistas of the wood as he
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_310' id='Page_310'>310</a></span>
spoke. The noise of the city, the harsh yelling and
the rumble of carts, came to them clearly from the
near-by street. Dian put it so, saying that Champar
was doing all this for them out of the kindness of
his heart. He did not say that he had done the
coach driver a service once which was so great that
it had meant life itself to him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell me what it is, Dian. I don’t know if I am
brave. I’m not sure. But for maman I could do it.
Shall we not go soon to Great-aunt Hortense’s house
so that I can see maman?” said Marie Josephine.
She could think of nothing else but that she was to
see her mother and aid in saving her. She tried to
realize that her great-aunt’s house was really her
mother’s prison, but it only seemed like a bad dream.
She could not believe that the dim, stately house,
where they had so often gone for chocolate on
winter afternoons, could now be a place from which
to flee, an enemy’s stronghold.</p>

<p class='c018'>She looked confidently at Dian, and the trust that
had always come to her when with him, steadied her
now.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tell me, Dian, what is it I shall do?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“A week from to-day, if all goes well, you and
the others will be with your mother in, or rather
near, Calais. Your sister, the governess, the Du
Monde and Proté are there now. I saw Champar
this morning and he told me where to find them. I
hope that a fishing schooner will take you all to
England. I spoke to your mother through the door
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_311' id='Page_311'>311</a></span>
for a moment this morning. She has been told that
her children are to join her in Calais, and she thinks
that you are already on your way. Henri has given
her that impression. He has given her, for a disguise,
the clothes of his sister who was to have gone
to a cousin in the country, and for whom he has procured
a passport. She is not able to leave, and your
mother will go in her stead. Her passport is in
order. When she leaves you at the garden gate she
is to go at once to the Place de la Bastille and has
orders what else to do. Little Mademoiselle, this
is hard—she must not know that it is her own Marie
Josephine who is saving her! Safety for you all lies
in her not knowing this, for she would not leave the
city if she thought that one of you were here!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine thought of all that Dian had
said, a little later, as she sat on a secluded bench in
the great entrance hall of Great-aunt Hortense’s
house. All about her were emblems of the revolution.
She would have laughed out loud at the
thought of Great-aunt Hortense’s horror if she had
not been too excited and tremulous to laugh at anything.
A tri-color banner was draped over the entrance
to the grand salon. At the carved oak table
in the center of the hall sat three men wearing red
caps, and all down the dusky corridors other red
caps bobbed up and down as citizens walked to and
fro debating and wrangling. From an anteroom, a
cold, gilded apartment, came a jangle of voices. A
meeting of one of the sections was taking place there.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_312' id='Page_312'>312</a></span>
All through the city were clubs or sections, each composed
of men with different ideas from the others,
no two ever agreeing on anything except to advocate
bloodshed and to show no mercy.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie had put her tray with its jug of licorice
water and its jangling cups on the floor beside her.
Vivi had left it for her at the stand of a nut seller
near the Marquise du Ganne’s house. All sorts of
booths and stands had sprung up overnight in the
once fashionable parts of Paris.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian would be waiting for Madame Saint Frère,
in her disguise as Henri’s sister, in the Place de la
Bastille. Henri had already been gone some hours
with his regiment. Marie Josephine was to seize
her opportunity to slide through the shadowy halls,
up the back stairs to the room at the end of the hall.
Her heart beat so fast that it seemed as though
some one must hear it. She saw that it was not
going to be an easy thing to slip away, and she made
up her mind that she must not, under any circumstance,
let any chance go by. Some men came up to
her and demanded a drink. She stooped over for
her tray and stood up.</p>

<p class='c018'>She did not feel as though it were herself at all
who poured the sickish-looking, grey mixture into
the tin cups and received in exchange coins which
she put in the pocket of her torn skirt. She was
careful not to speak any more than she could help,
for fear that her voice would betray her. She could
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_313' id='Page_313'>313</a></span>
look like Vivi, and instinct seemed to tell her how
to be like her, but she was afraid of her voice.</p>

<p class='c018'>As she walked about among the crowd, through
the old familiar halls, selling her wares, she remembered
what Dian had said: “Have no fear. Fear is
nothing and it cannot talk to you or keep you from
doing what is right. It has no power!” She remembered
something else that he had said: “You
are so changed. It will be easy, indeed, for your
mother not to think of you at all, except as a part
of her rescue. Shake your hair well over your face
and do not look directly at her more than you
can help. Remember she thinks that you are near
Calais!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian had given her the two keys. She could feel
them jingling together in her inner pocket. She
wanted to put her tray down somewhere so that
she could slip away more easily at the right moment.
She waited until there was a lull in the demand for
licorice water, then quietly slipped over to a corner
and ducked her head from under the leather strap
which held the tray about her neck. As she put the
tray down on the floor and turned away some one
called to her. It was Georges Fardou, the man who
had let Vivi through the gates to “Pick a flower.”
He looked like a big, shadowy giant as he stood
there in the dark hall.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Come, give us a dance like the one at the West
Barricade. The 'Ça Ira,’ or anything that’s full of
go!” he called with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_314' id='Page_314'>314</a></span>
The “Ça Ira.” She had heard it sung in the streets
that very morning as she had come through the rue
Royale with Dian. She had seen it danced, too, a
wild, strange weaving in and out of dreadful people.
She had shut her eyes at Dian’s bidding and held
tight to his hand, and he had talked to her in his
quiet way of Pigeon Valley, as they walked through
the city.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll do another one to-day,” she heard herself
saying, and it seemed as though she spoke harshly
without trying, her mouth was so dry.</p>

<p class='c018'>She began to dance, holding her tattered skirts
about her, swaying back and forth in the dim, close
air. She had danced this way so many times before
at Les Vignes, up and down the veranda and through
the tall rows of white lilies along the south terrace.
She tried to think of these happy times as she danced
in and out of the arched doorways and about the big
table in the center of the hall. Applause greeted
her as she stopped, and also a harsh voice from the
anteroom door.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Have the brat clear out, and keep some sort of
quiet about here while the section’s in session,” said
the voice from the doorway, and then its owner disappeared.</p>

<p class='c018'>For a moment her heart stood still, but after a
laugh or two, the small crowd that had stood watching
her disappeared, Vivi’s friend among them. At
the first moment that she felt that she was unobserved,
she crept through the back of the entrance
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_315' id='Page_315'>315</a></span>
hall into a corridor beyond it, paused, listened, then
crept stealthily up the narrow winding stairs.</p>

<p class='c018'>She knew the room. One time when they had
been staying with her great-aunt for several weeks,
she had spent an afternoon there with Proté, dear
Proté!</p>

<p class='c018'>She stood in the shadow close against the wall,
looking down the corridor. All was quiet. She put
the key in the lock and tried it. It gave easily and
she stepped inside, then shrank back against the
door, putting her hand over her mouth to smother
the little cry of surprise that had almost escaped
her. She had thought to find maman, and in her
place there was a thin, wispy-haired woman in a
snuff-colored cape and close-fitting drab bonnet, with
a greasy face and half-shut eyes. It was maman!
As she stood there by the door Marie Josephine remembered
something Great-aunt Hortense had said:
“There never was any one like your mother, Marie,
for play-acting. Ah, you children can’t believe it,
but it’s true. The queen has begged her to join them
at Versailles! She could do her beloved Molière
characters best of all.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Come, you’re sure you were not watched, little
girl?” maman was saying.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine nodded.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Then come at once—the back stairs—you know
the garden door? I’ve never been that way myself.
Quick, child!”</p>

<p class='c018'>The voice was the same!</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_316' id='Page_316'>316</a></span>
“You’d best talk like a woman of the people, citizeness,
otherwise you are splendid in your disguise!”
Marie Josephine clasped her hands together suddenly,
looking up for a second into maman’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, yes, I know. I will remember, but be quick,
child.” Maman put her hand on the door, and
Marie Josephine stepped back into the hall, keeping
close to the wall. There was only silence, except
for the voices from the halls below.</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine never forgot the breathless flight
through the familiar back halls of the great house.
In spite of the tense excitement she thought how
funny it was that she knew the halls so well, and
maman knew them not at all! Roaming about
houses had always been one of Marie Josephine’s
chief delights!</p>

<p class='c018'>She tried to remember what Dian had told her:
“Do not let fear keep you from doing what is right.
Fear has no power.” She said this over and over
under her breath as they went out the side door into
the garden, and found themselves facing the grey
wall that surrounded it. There were voices near by.
She fumbled with the lock. It was rusty, and the
garden door was a little swollen from recent spring
rains. It did not give.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Hurry, child!” Maman’s voice sounded in her
ears. She stood quietly with the key in her hands
for a moment, trying to still the agony of fear that
seemed to beat about her. “Fear has no power,”
Dian had said. She felt a sudden freedom. She
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_317' id='Page_317'>317</a></span>
was doing right. She put the key in the lock again
and turned it quickly. The door caught, moved a
breath, then caught again. At last it gave! They
were outside in a deserted long, grey street. Maman
turned to her, and even in that moment of still great
danger, put her arm around her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You have done me good service, little one. I
have children whom I shall see very soon. They
are safe out of Paris, a son and two daughters. You—there
is something about you a little like one of
them. God bless you.”</p>

<p class='c018'>They had been given their directions. Maman
was off, walking quickly in the direction of the Place
de la Bastille, not daring to run. Marie Josephine
watched her until she had almost disappeared.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is something about you a little like one of
them!”</p>

<p class='c018'>The words stayed with her as she ran on toward
the rue Royale. When she reached the crowded
streets she slackened her steps. She was to go at
once to the Saint Frère house and to wait there with
the others for Dian.</p>

  <h2 id='ch24' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter XXIV</span> <br /> <br />THROUGH THE GATES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Raoul woke up feeling very ill the morning of
the day that Marie Josephine went to the house of
Great-aunt Hortense and let her mother through the
garden door. He had eaten heartily of pig’s feet
and apricot preserve, presents to the seed shopman
and his family from the market gardener’s wife.</p>

<p class='c018'>Late that same afternoon Dian visited him in his
stuffy room at the top of the seed shop. He found
him cross and unhappy. His head ached and he
could not stop thinking about the pig’s feet and the
apricot preserve, much as he tried to do so. He did
not have a great many things besides food to think
about, and felt at a loss. He cheered up on seeing
his shepherd friend, and when Dian rose to take his
leave, said he felt better. Dian went out and came
back again with some grapes. He placed them in a
cracked dish on a table near the oat-straw shakedown
where Raoul was lying.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You will be glad of their refreshment in the
morning, though you make a face at them now,” he
said, smiling. Then he sat down again on a stool
near the rough bed.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_319' id='Page_319'>319</a></span>
“My master’s friend who knows of medicine saw
me, and he says I’ll not be able to leave the city for
some days; I have fever,” Raoul said, giving his
hard pillow an impatient poke. Dian took the
pillow and shook it up, and lifted Raoul so that he
rested more comfortably. Then he sat quietly beside
him, thinking deeply.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Will your master drive out the cart himself,
then?” he asked the boy.</p>

<p class='c018'>Raoul shook his head vigorously.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Not him! He’s deep in talking, talking all the
time, going to section meetings, and quarreling with
everybody. Tortot the baker won’t speak to him
or to the seed shopman. He’s just about distracted
since they broke down his shop and played such
havoc with his goods. He hasn’t dared to open up
the shop since because of the mob.” Raoul raised
his head from the pillow and spoke confidentially to
Dian. “He doesn’t say anything about the boy that
disappeared from the shop that night. He knows
he’d get himself into a good measure of trouble over
hiding an aristocrat that way. They’d say in the
convention he was trying to help him get away, instead
of holding him until the right time to get rid
of him. Oh, you can wager he’ll keep still enough
about that. I don’t care what they do. I’m going
to stay home when once I get there. I hate this old
place and everybody here but you!” At this last
remark Raoul became so upset that he threw the
pillow to the other end of the room. He seemed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_320' id='Page_320'>320</a></span>
feel better after he had done so, for he grinned at
Dian.</p>

<p class='c018'>The door opened just then and the market gardener
came in, a prosperous-looking, red-faced man
in grey breeches and dark-brown waistcoat decorated
with the tri-colored rosette.</p>

<p class='c018'>“A fine boy, a fine boy. He would do well to eat
only black bread and garlic for a time. He’s been
living too high, that’s what’s the matter with him!”
he exclaimed in his bluff way, standing over the cot
and looking good-naturedly down at Raoul.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian stood, and, leaning over, laid his hands on
Raoul’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I will see you again before very long, perhaps at
your home in the country that you love. Sometime
I will show you my flock of sheep, and you will meet
the little Jean of whom I have told you,” he said.
Then he turned to the market gardener. “I know a
boy who will drive your cart to-morrow, if you like.
He lives in a cellar, and is in dire straits. He will
be only too glad of earning even a few coins, for he
has a journey before him, and a mother and sisters
dependent upon him. I’d like to do him the good
turn.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Now Dian was a prime favorite with the market
gardener, who was constantly wrangling with the
men he knew in the city, though he cared not a fig for
any of them except the seed shopman. He admired
Dian’s bulk and his free, fearless ways. “There’s
a man for you,” he would say. “There’s a man of
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_321' id='Page_321'>321</a></span>
France, with a broad back and broad ways. There’s
a man!” He greeted Dian’s suggestion cordially.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Bring on your boy. I want one I can trust, and
these Paris brats are as sly as their fathers. I, for
one, will be glad to get away from the whole dirty,
quarrelsome lot of them,” he said. There was an
answering mutter of agreement from the bed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He is a friend of the little Vivi, and a worthy
lad. Where will I find the cart? I will myself see
that the lad is started in good time and order,”
said Dian.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It will stand, as always, at the end of the row by
the West Barricade, and I will see that it is ready.
You can tell him the road and the way, as you know
the country about, but it would be well for me to
have a word with him. You say he knows the road?
He’s not one of the city brats?” As the market
gardener asked this last question, he took out his
long pipe and lit it. Settling back on the stool that
Dian had vacated, he drew a long puff from it,
unconscious of the wry face that Raoul made as
the tobacco smoke filled the room.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He knows all the country near you, for he comes
from the road east of Calais, and has been back and
forth in summer weather many times,” Dian answered.
Then he opened the door and went out,
saying over his shoulder as he did so:</p>

<p class='c018'>“The lad and I will be at the West Barricade
to-morrow at sundown, or just before the gates close.
You never go until then, I take it?”</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_322' id='Page_322'>322</a></span>
“No, we hold on for the trade until dusk. I’ll be
there by the cart. Raoul here will be his own man
in a few days, and will, I hope, have learned his
lesson about going slow with pigs’ feet,” answered
Raoul’s master.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Give my regards to the funny fat man in the
brown cloak,” called Raoul, and Dian could hear
him laughing, weak as he was, as he went down the
seed shop stairs.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian knew that all had gone well with Marie
Josephine, for he had stayed about the house and
halls, and had known when she had gone up the back
stairs, though no one else had seen the little grey
figure slip away. He had gone out and waited,
fighting the fear that almost choked him as the
minutes seemed to fly by, and the door in the garden
wall did not open. Then he had seen them come
out and go their different ways, as they had been
told to do, and so, instead of going in again to the
house, to give his life if need be for them, he had
gone on to the seed shop and there, as always, he
had found a way.</p>

<p class='c018'>He felt a sense of relief in the knowledge that
Henri had gone with his regiment that morning, for
though he was grateful that the man had waked up
to his real self, putting his cowardice aside and doing
a last act of helpfulness in aiding the comtesse to
escape, still the knowledge of the hidden cellar was
not for him. Dian, when he reached the Saint Frère
house, walked up and down the upper cellar for
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_323' id='Page_323'>323</a></span>
some time, his hands clasped before him, his face
lifted to the dark, dusty rafters. He felt that the
old comte was very near to him, not a wraith of his
person, but the loving earnestness of his spirit. He
was doing the best he knew how, this shepherd, in
his own simple way. To him it meant only trusting
in the power of good to stand by them.</p>

<p class='c018'>As soon as he had opened the slide he heard
Marie Josephine’s voice calling softly to him. The
lanthorn had made a scraping noise against the stone
wall as he lifted it. Faint as it was, she had heard
it, for she had been sitting on the lowest rung of the
stairs, listening for him, ever since she had returned,
breathless and half bewildered, from the house of
Great-aunt Hortense.</p>

<p class='c018'>She stood before him with clasped hands as he
emerged from the gloom of the stairs.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Maman is safe? Tell me, Dian!” She caught
his sleeve and held on to it as they walked toward
the others. Rosanne was sleeping in the alcove near
the chest. Lisle was walking up and down in the
room beyond, Humphrey Trail beside him, both
talking earnestly. Jean, who was now very much
awake, ran up to Dian and took hold of the other
side of his coat.</p>

<p class='c018'>“She is out of Paris. She reached the Place de la
Bastille and went off in the coach as Henri’s sister.
The passport was in order. I watched her go
through the gates in a public coach. I saw you open
the garden gate. You did not come in vain to Paris,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_324' id='Page_324'>324</a></span>
Little Mademoiselle!” the shepherd answered her,
and his words of praise, as well as the welcome news
of her mother’s safety, brought sudden tears to her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I do not feel little any more, Dian. I have
grown up these last days,” she said, turning to meet
Rosanne, who had wakened, and who, with the
others, came crowding up to them. Lisle and Marie
Josephine held each other’s hands, and Marie Josephine
hid her face in his sleeve. Their mother was
safe out of Paris. Dian had seen her drive out of
the gates in a coach. Very simply Marie Josephine
told them what she had done as they all stood about
her, tense and eager.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You danced for those men there in the hall—you!
They thought you were Vivi!” Lisle could
not believe it. His sister, Marie Josephine!</p>

<p class='c018'>He stood very still while she told them of going
up to her mother, slipping through the dusk when
no one saw her, and finding a strange woman of the
people who was maman and yet was not! “Maman
was so wonderful. I told her that she must try to
speak like the people. I said, 'Citizeness, you will
do well to remember that you must have the speech
of the people at the gates.’ The key would not
turn in the lock at first—I mean in the garden door
lock—but it did at last and we got safely outside.
Maman did not know me, of course. Maman thinks
that we are waiting for her near Calais, but just as
she said good-by she—she—said, 'There is something
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_325' id='Page_325'>325</a></span>
about you a little like—like one of them ch—children——’”
Marie Josephine drew this last out
in a long sob, putting her face down in the hollow
of her arm.</p>

<p class='c018'>How they comforted her, one and all. Humphrey
told stories of his Yorkshire farm, until he
had to clear his throat again and again, and they
begged him to go on even when he said he simply
could not say another word. He held Jean on his
knee and sang a funny Yorkshire song to him. The
time flew by with happy talk as they roasted apples
over the little fire, no one objecting in the least to
the smoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian sat back in a far corner, his hands clasped
on his knee, his eyes closed. The hidden cellar had
performed its task, had justified itself. It had saved
the lives of two of the Saint Frères, and of their
friends. It had proved itself to be a stronghold, a
refuge, even a home. It had opened its dark arms
to receive the last Lisle Saint Frère, protecting him
from those who would have had his head on the
guillotine block. It had opened those same arms
for the little girl who knew and loved it, and who
had been the one of her generation chosen to know
of it. To-morrow was in God’s hands. Dian was
not afraid. He was glad for many things. He was
glad to hear children’s laughter, glad that the comtesse
was through the gates and that Marie Josephine
had been the one to aid her, glad of the friendship
of honest Humphrey Trail, and that there
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_326' id='Page_326'>326</a></span>
would be a safe refuge for them all with Humphrey
in England.</p>

<p class='c018'>He stood up, his great height bringing him almost
to a level with the rough stone ceiling, and, coming
over to them, answered their welcoming call of
“Dian, come and stay with us,” with a smile that
had in it something of sadness. Then he went over
to the chest and, standing by it, beckoned them to
come to him. They came, all of them, and looked
at him in wonder as he stood there lost in thought.</p>

<p class='c018'>Suddenly he turned toward Lisle, who stood beside
him, and he touched him lightly on the shoulder.
It was as though he was knighting him for something.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You are the last of these Saint Frères who have
been such a brave race of men. You have the name
of the first one of them of whom there is record,
and of whom there is much to remember. He
helped to build this hidden place with his own hands.
He said that one member of the family in each
generation should know of this cellar and, knowing,
should bear in mind always that it was built with a
prayer, and that the prayer was to remember one’s
brother, to turn away from tyranny and the lust of
power. That was what the first Lisle Saint Frère
wanted of those of his own blood who were to come
after him.” Dian looked at Lisle as he spoke.
“Your grandfather was the one who came nearest
to the first Lisle’s wish. Of that I am sure,” he
said simply.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_327' id='Page_327'>327</a></span>
Then Lisle did a strange thing, so unlike him
that those about him could not believe their eyes.
He clasped his hands as though in prayer and stood
silent for a moment, and it was as though he neither
saw nor was aware of those about him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Help me to be like the first Lisle,” he prayed.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Dian—see Dian’s face!” whispered Rosanne to
Marie Josephine, and they both turned and looked
up at the shepherd. There was a light on his face,
and in his eyes a depth of happiness.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian took a key from his inner pocket, and stooping
over, unlocked the chest. Then he turned and
looked again at Lisle.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I believe that you will be like the first Lisle and
that you will have knowledge beyond his to work
out a way of helping the people, and all those that
need you,” he said. Then he leaned over, and,
reaching down into the depths of the chest, drew
out a tray. It was made of iron and it exactly fitted
the chest. On it were bags, some of goatskin, some
of raw hides, several of velvet, and one of leather.</p>

<p class='c018'>He touched them softly with his hands, tenderly,
broodingly, the way a miser might have touched his
wealth, after the visit of an angel who had awakened
him to the glories of giving, instead of keeping.</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is gold here, old money, some of which
is valueless but for the spirit in which it was given.
The one of each generation who has known of the
secret cellar has put something here, has given of
his store,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_328' id='Page_328'>328</a></span>
“I haven’t anything to give,” said Marie Josephine,
a quiver in her voice.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You offered your life, but the sacrifice was not
needed,” the shepherd answered her.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am the last Lisle now and I have nothing to
give,” Lisle said in the humble way which was new
to him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You would have given your life a hundred times
over, had there been a way. You have given a
prayer that is better than all this,” Dian answered
him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Whom does it belong to?” asked Jean, who was
delighted with the rows of little bags inside the odd
old chest.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian put his hand again on Lisle’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It belongs to this Lisle,” he said. Then he
reached down and picked up a dark-stained piece of
paper. There were letters on the paper, burnt into
the parchment with the sharp end of a stick. They
were so curiously worded that Lisle had to study
them, when Dian handed him the paper, before he
could make them out. They were in French, but
of the old language. After a moment of silence
Lisle read very slowly:</p>

<p class='c018'>“In the hour of need thou shall of this treasure
give to the creatures who have the sorest want.
Keep to thine own that for thy bread. Give of the
rest, not to thyself, but to thy brother!”</p>

<p class='c018'>There was silence there in the depths of the earth
after Lisle had read from the parchment. It seemed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_329' id='Page_329'>329</a></span>
to stay with them all the evening. It seemed almost
as though it spoke to them. “Give of the rest, not
to thyself, but to thy brother.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Long ago Dian had gone over the bags with the
old comte. He and Lisle now put away, in the
bottom of the chest, the quaint old coins in their
faded bags, handling them tenderly as though they
loved them. They decided to take two bags of the
more modern money with them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Remember that I leave you at the boat, and that
you must find out, with Humphrey’s aid, whether
the English government can change this for you. It
may be worthless now, except for its value in gold,”
Dian said to Lisle.</p>

<p class='c018'>They locked the chest and laid the two bags of
money on the shelf next to the horn drinking cups.
It was late and Jean was beginning to yawn.</p>

<p class='c018'>Humphrey went about through the narrow alcove-like
rooms beyond, putting a rug here and a pillow
there, intent on everyone’s comfort and glad indeed
to have something to do, for he was sorely troubled.
It was all very well to spend one’s time over an old
chest, and he had been as interested as the others;
but to-morrow they were to make a run for their
lives! He knew that Dian had some plan, and that
there had been no chance to tell him. He was relieved
beyond words when the shepherd called them
all together.</p>

<p class='c018'>Years afterward Humphrey used to recall that
night to himself as he sat in a corner of his own fire-side,
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_330' id='Page_330'>330</a></span>
his pipe between his lips. Neighbors happening
in would have to speak to him several times
before he would be aware of their presence. “Ah—yes—welcome
in. I was thinking back a long way,
a long way,” he would say. Dian in their midst
telling them about “to-morrow!”</p>

<p class='c018'>It was very simple. Dian and Humphrey had
passports, being citizens, one of France, the other
one of England. There had been no trouble about
them. Dian’s parents, who were not living, were
known to have been good, honest citizens in their
day, who had been oppressed by the aristocrats. He
himself was a shepherd. Humphrey was a farmer
who had been in France on a holiday. They would
pass out at the gates after the children had gone
through.</p>

<p class='c018'>And how was that to be done? The little Vivi
again. Georges Fardou, her friend, was on guard
at sundown. That Dian knew well. He was always
there when the carts went out. A boy, a friend of
Vivi’s, would drive a vegetable cart, the market
gardener would be there himself to see that all was
in order. He would explain to the gatemen that
the lad was taking Raoul’s place and was quite to be
trusted. The lad would be Lisle!</p>

<p class='c018'>The children, Rosanne and Jean and Marie Josephine,
were to run about with Vivi. She was Georges
Fardou’s friend and he never resisted her appeals.
He would let them run through and play on the
other side for a while. They would be met by
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_331' id='Page_331'>331</a></span>
Champar, who had fleet horses ready. They must
not fear. That was as definite a plan as they could
agree upon.</p>

<p class='c018'>All knew that there was a great risk, but there
was little fear in the hearts of any of them that night
in the cellar. They sat about on one of the big rugs
and ate their late supper of bread and cheese and
chocolate. Then they went to their various cosy
beds of shawls and rugs, and slept soundly until
morning.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was while Humphrey was frying the bacon for
breakfast, assisted by Marie Josephine, who stood
by the frying pan and turned the slices with a one-pronged
fork when they began to brown nicely, that
Lisle spoke with Dian.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am glad that I shall not be with the others
going through the gates, for some one might recognize
me and suspect them all. I am so much taller
than the others, too big to be a playmate for Vivi.
Tell me, Dian, what will become of her. I do not
like to leave her unbefriended. There must be something
we can do for her.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian was glad to hear Lisle say this, and his face
bore a very earnest look as he answered: “You are
right to ask for her, and I have told Mademoiselle
de Soigné and the Little Mademoiselle that she is
safe. I will tell you more than this. I could not go
away from Paris leaving Vivi alone and unprotected,
to starve. She has been our friend, loyal always. I
shall take care of her in the country where she will
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_332' id='Page_332'>332</a></span>
be happy as the sunshine. I hope that Mother Barbette
will open her heart to her, finding in her the
little girl she has always wanted for her own. It
was easy to procure a passport for Vivi, and she
leaves the gates to-morrow at twelve——”</p>

<p class='c018'>“But you said—I don’t understand—— How can
Marie Josephine be taken for her if she has already
gone?” Lisle looked up, deeply puzzled.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Do you not see? Her friend, Georges Fardou,
will not be there at noon. He comes on duty always
at five. He will know nothing of Vivi’s having left
and will play the game of letting her through the
gates as usual. What we must hope—aye, and
pray—is that he will let her little comrades through
also!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle smiled. “You are you, Dian. Next you
will tell me that the others at Pigeon Valley are
safe!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“That I can tell you now. Listen well. They are
safe enough in a deserted barn near Calais. Champar,
the cross-eyed coach driver, took them there.
I was saving this to tell you at the last before we
leave, in order to give you all, especially Mademoiselle
de Soigné, good courage.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Cécile du Monde in a deserted barn!” Lisle
threw back his head in the old way. Then he
laughed. “We are all a set of vagabonds. Eh
bien! so much the better. Rosanne,” he called to
her over his shoulder, “we are tramps, all of us.
Dian has more news. Cécile and Bertran and that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_333' id='Page_333'>333</a></span>
funny Proté and Madame le Pont and Hortense are
safe, hiding in a barn——”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I know,” she interrupted. “Marie Josephine
told me last night before we went to sleep. She
said we must be quiet about it and not talk too much,
because there was so much to plan. She told me
that I must not speak at all by the gates or afterward,
for fear I would give myself away, but I’ve
remembered ever so many things that Vivi used to
say, and when I’m dressed in tatters I think I can
talk like her.” Rosanne smiled cheerfully as she
spoke, but her smile faded a little, later in the day,
when all her long, soft, golden hair was sheared
and fell in a glittering heap on the chest. She did
not cry, but there was a quiver about her mouth.
Dian picked the hair up and wrapped it in a piece
of satin that had covered one of the pillows they
had brought down.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It will not be safe to take it with us; but remember,
Mademoiselle, nothing can happen to the hidden
cellar. Some day we will come here to the chest and
find it and give it to your mother in memory of the
old days in France, which will be dear to her,” he
said, laying the bright bundle in a corner of the
chest.</p>

<p class='c018'>They all laughed at each other, for they were the
sorriest sights imaginable. Vivi lived in one of the
worst alleys in Paris, and her friends were the most
unkempt of all the children who played about the
gates. Rosanne’s hair they discolored with a dark
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_334' id='Page_334'>334</a></span>
fluid, and they rubbed dye into her delicate face and
arms and hands. She wore a tattered dress, which
had a berry stain down the front, and no stockings
under her broken shoes. They had not dared to let
her go barefooted because of her feet betraying her.
Marie Josephine was Vivi, in the torn dirty dress
that had stood the journey from Pigeon Valley, her
uncombed hair flapping about her face and eyes.
She was tanned like a veritable gypsy, and there was
no need of any more disguise for her. She was the
street gamin to perfection, and she had the gift of
knowing how to play a part. She had confidence,
too. The experience at the house of Great-aunt
Hortense had given it to her. She was full of fire
and courage and the love of adventure. She was
ready!</p>

<p class='c018'>“The last of the Saint Frères! Oh, you funny
boy!” She danced about her brother mockingly.
“What an honest country lad you look, to be sure,
does he not, Humphrey Trail?” she cried laughingly.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He does look out of his usual way, but tha knows
he is the same. I’m fashed to see how any one else
could tell him to be the proud lad he is,” Humphrey
answered slowly, surveying Lisle soberly.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle gave him a quick smile. “Humphrey Trail,
the only friend I had in Paris the day the Tuileries
was sacked,” he said, and a look of friendship passed
between the two.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian regarded Lisle gravely and then nodded.
Yes, he would do. His hair was cut short and dyed
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_335' id='Page_335'>335</a></span>
also, and he wore a homespun suit and rough, awkward
shoes. His coarse shirt was open at his throat,
which showed brown enough from the dye, and his
eyebrows were ruffed up and there was a splash of
cherry juice across one of them. He was to be eating
cherries as he drove through with the cart. He
stood before them, a far different figure from the
Lisle Saint Frère who had danced the minuet at the
De Soigné ball.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Well, it’s time to start. We are ready, all of
us.” Dian spoke in his usual simple, direct way and
they followed him without a word. Marie Josephine
was the last to climb the ladder stairs. She
looked back at the quiet, tender gloom of the old
place. “Good-by,” she whispered. “Sometime we
are coming back, all of us!”</p>

<p class='c018'>They each knew what to do and there was no
need for discussion. Dian and Humphrey, accompanied
by Lisle, went on ahead, and the two little
girls with Jean followed at a distance but kept near
enough so as not to lose sight of them. In any case
they were to find their way to the West Barricade.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was dusk when they reached the gates, and the
first pink glow of a spring sunset showed above the
tall, gaunt forge that was busy near by making guns
for the army of the revolution.</p>

<p class='c018'>The market gardener stood by the empty cart
and hailed Dian and Humphrey cheerfully. Then
he looked Lisle over from head to foot. Lisle was
eating cherries unconcernedly and only gave a sheepish
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_336' id='Page_336'>336</a></span>
side nod to the market gardener as he looked
him over.</p>

<p class='c018'>“He seems fond of cherries, that lad of yours,”
he said to Dian. “Bien! I must go to a meeting.
See that you hurry on. As it is you’ll not be at my
farm before night. The shepherd here says you
know the way. Here’s your pay. Good-day, citizens,”—and
the stout, fussy man hurried away to
wrangle at a meeting until well into the morning.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle jumped on to the cart and took the reins.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Remember, Champar is to be waiting a few rods
from the gates. Leave the horse and cart under a
tree by the first turn. Champar will see that they
reach the market gardener’s. He has told his cousin
to fetch them there. Drive as quickly as you can.
Don’t talk with the soldier at the gates unless you
are forced to.” Dian spoke quickly in a low tone.
Lisle nodded, took the reins, and drove toward the
Barricade. A soldier stopped him, but he had been
told that another lad would drive through with the
cart and he knew the cart well. It had red wheels,
and he and Raoul had often joked about it.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You’ll be where your friend is if you eat many
of those this time of year, young citizen,” the man
said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle made a face, but said nothing, holding out
some cherries to the man, who accepted two or
three. It was Vivi’s friend, Georges Fardou, who
came on duty at half past five.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_337' id='Page_337'>337</a></span>
He waved his hand. “Go on with you,” he said,
and Lisle drove through.</p>

<p class='c018'>“So, citizens, you are leaving the gay city—what?”
Georges Fardou examined the passports of
Humphrey and Dian critically, holding his lanthorn
close up to them, for it was dark under the frowning
shadow of the walls. He had had many a friendly
chat with both of them at odd times, there at the
gates, and had often sat next to Dian at meetings
of the sections.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes, and the children would come just a pace
with us. It’s a good hour before the gates close,
and they’ve followed us about all day,” Dian said
simply, nodding toward a group of three laughing
children, a boy and two girls, who were throwing
mud at each other, and every now and then at
passers-by.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Vivi and I are good comrades, I was with the
poor father when he died,” Humphrey said, not as
though he were pleading for her to go through, but
just stating a fact in his quiet way.</p>

<p class='c018'>Georges nodded. “That was a bad thing. I’d
like to see all of the aristos get the hit he got, poor
devil. Well, many a one is getting hit at the back
of the neck, good luck to the guillotine!” He
glanced at the children who had come up to them.
“It’s too late for you brats to go through the gates,
and it’s against orders,” he said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then out of her eagerness and her love for those
dear to her who were in peril, Marie Josephine
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_338' id='Page_338'>338</a></span>
spoke, and her very earnestness gave her courage.
It was so dark there in the shadow of the wall that
only her eager eyes seemed to show in her dark face
as she looked up at the guard.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I may not see the shepherd again. He has been
kinder to me than any one since my father died,
him and Humphrey, the funny farmer man,” Marie
Josephine spoke in a hoarse, almost harsh voice.</p>

<p class='c018'>Georges Fardou shook his head. “It’s too late,”
he said again.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Please—Georges Fardou.” There was a world
of pleading in her voice, and a tear was zigzagging
down her cheek as she looked up pleadingly at
Georges Fardou.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Bien! Out with the lot of you, but mind you’re
not late coming back. It will be closing time within
the hour.” He unlocked the gates again as he had
done for Lisle and the cart. “Good-by, citizens,
and a good journey,” he called to Dian and Humphrey
as they went through. “When you come back
you’ll find Antoinette has gone the way of Louis.
Long live the Republic!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then he closed the gates after them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 id='ch25' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Chapter XXV</span> <br /> <br />OUT OF THE MIST</h2>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Grigge gave the note to Anastasius Grubb and
watched him as he read it. He was not thinking so
much about the note, or what Anastasius would do,
as he was about the man himself, for he was the
oddest man that he had ever seen; his beard was so
rich and full and brown, his voice so deep, so like a
bellows, and his eyebrows so thick and frowning.
After he had read the note he looked Grigge over
as though he thought he was rather curious also.
Then he destroyed the note. It was the one that
Humphrey had written, and that Dian had sent, with
his own, to Grigge, first by Raoul and then by Champar.
Champar had gone back to Paris. Grigge was
watching for him every day now, and he knew that
the little party of fugitives in the forsaken barn near
the city were watching, too.</p>

<p class='c018'>Anastasius knew some French, having picked it
up while carrying on his trade back and forth, and
he used it now on Grigge.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’ll be waiting every night with a rowboat by
the willow woods three miles south of the light-house
station. I’ll keep hidden, and I’ll see that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_340' id='Page_340'>340</a></span>
the schooner doesn’t bring suspicion on itself. Tell
them I’ll be waiting. I’d do that and more for
Humphrey Trail. We’ve played together as lads
and, please Heaven, we’ll continue friends this many
a year to come.” Anastasius relapsed into English
at the last, but Grigge understood about the willow
woods and the boat. He thought of Dian and
that he would soon be seeing him and he smiled.
That made him look so different that the skipper
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c018'>“Th’art na so ugly when tha smiles; that th’art
not!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then Grigge left him and went back through long
circuitous ways through the country roads to the
barn. He walked slowly and with the satisfied air
of one who has at last accomplished something of
moment. He had waited patiently day after day
near the docks at Calais for a glimpse of the skipper
of the <i>Sandlass</i>. Champar had been gone over a
week and still there was no sign of this Anastasius
Grubb, who alone, of all the owners of fishing crafts
in and around the harbor, could take safely to England
the little band of people who were at his mercy
in Champar’s uncle’s barn, near the coast.</p>

<p class='c018'>Grigge shuffled along in the dust that reminded
him of the highway in Pigeon Valley. He thought
of the croak of the frogs at night in the brook that
ran along the back of the meadow behind the huts.
He thought of the black bread that he had always
eaten, and of the low-ceilinged, one-roomed hut that
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_341' id='Page_341'>341</a></span>
was his home. He had never meant anything to
these people who awaited him in the lonely barn.
Not one of them at Les Vignes, except the Little
Mademoiselle, had ever given him more than a passing
nod. All that he had done for them was because
of Dian, but he had expected to taunt them with it,
to humiliate them as they had so often, perhaps unthinkingly,
humiliated him. He had thought that
it would be fun to tease them, to tell them that the
plan had fallen through and that there would be no
possibility of the others reaching them; but he had
not done any of these things, and as he walked along
the quiet road that lovely May night, he felt closer
to the sheltering greenness and the peaceful, drifting
wind than he had ever felt before.</p>

<p class='c018'>When he came within the region of the barn he
dropped to his knees and crawled slowly through
the dark underbrush. It would never do for a late
passer-by on the road to Calais to see him going
to the barn, which was so unusually isolated, half
hidden by brush and trees. It was a remarkable
hiding place.</p>

<p class='c018'>Cécile met him, having slid back the door when
she heard his faint rap. The main part of the barn
was lighted by three lanthorns which hung from the
ceiling, but the light was dim, and there was a thick
blanket hung across the one window, so that no
glimmer could reach the fields beyond.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I delivered the letter. He’s to wait every night
by the willow woods. He says this Humphrey
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_342' id='Page_342'>342</a></span>
Trail’s his best friend. He’s safe. He won’t desert
you.” There was a kinder tone in Grigge’s voice,
for something in the eager way they listened to him
touched him.</p>

<p class='c018'>Madame le Pont said, “Thank God.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Cécile shut her eyes for a moment and then she
said:</p>

<p class='c018'>“They will come. I know they are safe. We had
word that they were going to try to get through.
That blessed cross-eyed Champar sent the message
to us.” Cécile turned and put her arms about Denise
who had come close to her. “We’ll see them, chérie,
soon,” she whispered. Denise could only sob on
Cécile’s shoulder. She at last was learning what it
was to be in a revolution.</p>

<p class='c018'>Hortense touched Grigge’s arm. “There is some
supper here for you, an omelette that I’m cooking.
It’s made with two of the eggs you brought us yesterday.
Proté has taught me to cook it, and I want
you to say it’s good!” She spoke in a friendly way,
and nothing could have showed plainer than her
manner how they were all learning to know one another
and to help. It was necessary that they keep
occupied, and Hortense and Proté had many a laugh
over the former’s attempt at cooking. Bertran was
the greatest problem, for he was determined to go
out, and they trembled that he would in some way,
in spite of his disguise, make trouble by causing suspicion.
The days had gone by and they had not
seen a living soul but themselves. Grigge had gone
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_343' id='Page_343'>343</a></span>
away every morning and stayed away all day, searching
for Anastasius Grubb, whom at last he had
found, and who had promised them his aid when
the dear ones from Paris should come.</p>

<p class='c018'>And the wayfarers—they who had come through
the gates of Paris, through danger so great that it
had seemed a simple thing to take one’s chance
at once and without question when it came one’s
way—where were they? They were thundering
through the countryside, sometimes on the main
highroad, but mostly through back lanes and untraveled
pasture roads. The cart bumped about so
much that their very heads whirled and they had to
hold on just as hard as they could. They became
so exhausted that they fell asleep in spite of themselves
and their excitement. They ate what was
given them by Champar and Dian, swallowing their
food with dry lips and throats. Always there was
the dread of meeting advancing outposts of the
army. Once they had to hide, coach and all, for a
day and part of a night in a copse in the woods.</p>

<p class='c018'>One morning Champar turned to them, his eye
cocked severely.</p>

<p class='c018'>“If no one asks me once to-day if we’ll see the
others surely, and if they really are safe in the barn,
and if I am sure that Grigge was able to find Anastasius
Grubb, I’ll tell you all something!”</p>

<p class='c018'>They were all growing used to Champar, and
Marie Josephine and Rosanne answered at once,
“Tell us, Champar, hurry, tell us!” Lisle and Dian
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_344' id='Page_344'>344</a></span>
were walking beside the cart, and they came close
to the side of it when Champar spoke, but he calmly
urged his horse on and seemed suddenly lost in
thought.</p>

<p class='c018'>“What is it, Champar? Tell us!” Lisle put his
hand on the side of the coach and looked up at
the driver. Lisle was pale and tired and covered
with dust. He had driven all night, so that Dian
and Champar, who had had the brunt of the journey,
could rest. “Shall we see our mother? Tell
us, Champar.” Lisle’s lips quivered ever so slightly
as he spoke. “Tell us,” he repeated, and there was
the old imperious ring in his voice as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c018'>So Champar told them. At noon they would
meet the cart that had taken their mother out of
Paris. It would be waiting for them at a farmhouse
he knew well. It had had a day’s start and was
lightly loaded and there had been no reason for
making détours as their mother’s passport was en
règle and no one would suspect Henri Berier’s sister
of being an aristocrat! They would see their mother
by noon that day!</p>

<p class='c018'>Marie Josephine and Rosanne jumped out at the
next hill and walked up it together. Toward the
top they were joined by Lisle. Marie Josephine
picked a bunch of wild lilies, putting them in the buttonhole
of her jacket. Jean was on the box talking
to Champar as on that night that Champar had
given the two runaways a lift. Now and then the
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_345' id='Page_345'>345</a></span>
driver put his hands over his ears as Jean plied him
with questions.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s been so wonderful! Sometimes it seems like
a terrible, interesting dream—but we won’t see Dian
after we go to England.” Marie Josephine turned
her face away from the others toward a sweep of
golden wild lilies which gleamed like flakes of racing
sunshine through the wood on their right. She did
not want them to see her tears. They fell unseen on
the lilies she had gathered.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Maman! Maman! Maman!” The next moment
she was screaming in an agony of joy, all her
acting forgotten, all her poise and self-control lost.
The coach had stopped by a lane which led from a
farmhouse, and there stood a dark-eyed, slovenly
woman in a faded homespun dress—her maman!</p>

<p class='c018'>Lisle and Marie Josephine sat on each side of the
comtesse inside the coach, Jean and Dian sat on
the wide seat in front with Champar, who was so
ashamed of the tear that splashed over his big nose
that he swore under his breath and was cross to the
horses. Maman could only hold Marie Josephine
in her arms; nothing seemed to matter except that
and the touch of Lisle’s hand on hers.</p>

<p class='c018'>“My little dear one, my pigeon, my chérie,” she
murmured over and over to Marie Josephine, holding
her close to her fast-beating heart. “Darling,
you came! It was you, my own little baby. I said
there was something—do you remember, chérie,
how I told you, there by the garden door, that there
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_346' id='Page_346'>346</a></span>
was something about you that reminded me of—of——?”
Maman’s head went down over Marie
Josephine’s shock of tangled locks, and she sobbed
for a moment. Then she became more like her
quiet, self-contained self.</p>

<p class='c018'>It all seemed a dream, the sweet afternoon air,
the haze of heat, the scent of the field lilies and early
poppies. It was all a dream to Marie Josephine,
for she was very tired, but she felt her mother’s
arms about her and heard her mother’s endearing
words, which sounded sweeter than any she had ever
heard before. They had always been there, locked
deep in the comtesse’s heart, but she had never
known how much she wanted to say them until it
was, as she had thought, too late.</p>

<p class='c018'>They told her of Denise and the others, but they
were too tired, all of them, to do more than that.
There would be many a long winter evening in England
when they could tell each other’s adventures.
Now they must keep their thoughts on the barn, on
the others, and on the blessed fishing schooner which
would mean life for them.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dian sat with his eyes closed, unmindful of Jean’s
chatter with Champar. Vivi was safe. She had
gone through with her own passport the morning
before, fortunately unknown to her friend who had
night duty at the gate, and who had so unsuspectedly
let the other Vivi and her friends through the gates.
He would see that the others were safe, and then he
would take Vivi and Jean back to his own Pigeon
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_347' id='Page_347'>347</a></span>
Valley, to the comfort and welcoming blessing of
Mother Barbette and the quiet protection of the
little low-roofed house in the wood of the Les
Vignes demesne. He felt sure that the little house
was there, safe among its ferns and flowers, whatever
may have happened to the big one. Grigge!
He had great hopes and plans for Grigge!</p>

<p class='c018'>He walked up the next hill with Lisle.</p>

<p class='c018'>“You and Humphrey for friends! Maman safe!
Dian, what have any of us done to deserve it? Dian,
it isn’t for always; France is my home. Dian, I’m
not forgetting that I am the last one of the Saint
Frères. Whatever happens, you’ll take some of
the gold for—no, you’ll never want it, but for
Grigge. Tell me, Dian, is that a way of helping
a little?” Lisle looked up almost entreatingly into
the shepherd’s face.</p>

<p class='c018'>“That is one way. Making Grigge your friend
is a better one,” Dian answered him.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Grigge my friend? Yes, I see that that can be,”
Lisle answered.</p>

<p class='c018'>They had reached a lane and Champar stopped
his horses.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It was out here, wasn’t it, my young citizeness,
that you shoved your dog off on some farm children?
What’s that!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Something was dashing toward them down the
fern-scented lane, something long and slender and
grey. It was Flambeau!</p>

<p class='c018'>They drove on, encumbered by a dog who leaped
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_348' id='Page_348'>348</a></span>
from one to the other of them in wild delight, barking
so sharply that Champar swore out loud, declaring
he was tired of the whole lot of them, at the
same time winking back a tear and urging the horses
on furiously.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We should not take Flambeau, but, yes, we must,
for he is a part of us,” exclaimed the comtesse as
the dog’s warm tongue licked her face. He saw
through the disguise of each one of them, as though
his very love for them would not let him be deceived.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I would never, never have left you, Flambeau,
angel, if I hadn’t been a tramp girl, dearie. You
are so—so——” Marie Josephine murmured.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Such an aristo,” said Rosanne with a little choke,
and just then Madame Saint Frère drew her close
to her other side, and, putting an arm around each
girl, she said: “Rosanne will see her mother one
day. When last we heard from her she was safe
in the hospital with your father. She begged us to
see you safely out of the country and wrote that she
and your father would join us when they could.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Dian will care for them both, and will see that
they come to us,” answered Marie Josephine, and
her mother looked at the shepherd, who sat beside
Champar, with a world of confidence and gratitude
in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c018'>The lights of Calais glowed faintly through a sea
mist. Champar drove very slowly. He knew the
way, but the mist was thick and seemed to frighten
the horses. They were near the gates that led to
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_349' id='Page_349'>349</a></span>
his uncle’s barn. It was almost time for them to
alight and to walk through the field. A voice
reached them suddenly, a breathless, hoarse voice
which seemed to come out of the very heart of the
grey night.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Champar, quick! Listen! There isn’t a moment
to lose. We’re discovered, suspected! It was
that fool of a Bertran. He met a citizen who discovered
he was disguised. He was followed. Then
the man ran toward the town. They’ve all left
the barn and gone to the willow wood. Grubb’s
anchored near the shore there. Hurry! The mist
will hide the cart. That’s it, jump. I’ll catch you,
Little Mademoiselle. This way. Don’t let the dog
bark. Yes, this way, this way——”</p>

<p class='c018'>They were off through the mist, Grigge leading.
The ground was soggy, and once Rosanne fell, but
Dian caught her up and carried her. They did not
speak at all, and through the silence Dian thought
he heard the sound of horses’ hoofs on the highroad.</p>

<p class='c018'>They were making slow progress. Once Flambeau
barked.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Take care, maman, see, this way. I’ll guide
you.” Lisle took his mother’s arm, as he whispered
this. He held fast to Marie Josephine’s arm with
his other hand, and every time she tried to get away
from him, he whispered authoritatively, “You are
to stay right here beside me!” His desire to protect
his family was so great that it made him fierce.
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_350' id='Page_350'>350</a></span>
When Marie Josephine fell against a boulder, he
caught her up and carried her toward a faint, flickering
white spot, which was the light at the bow of
Anastasius Grubb’s rowboat.</p>

<p class='c018'>Grubb’s deep voice boomed softly through the
still air.</p>

<p class='c018'>“They’re coming. One of my men from the
schooner has been on the ground, listening. It means
hurry. He’s heard horses’ hoofs. Here you, boy,
I’ll take the little girl. Humphrey, you—Good!
That’s it. You help the woman, and you, shepherd,
take the boy Grigge and get away as quick as you
can, or your lives will not be worth a ha’penny.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The water splashed about them as they waded to
the rowboat, which was resting in shallow water.
Strong arms caught them, and in little more than a
breath they were seated close together, Denise with
her mother’s arms about her, Hortense and Marie
Josephine and Cécile huddled together in a tense
embrace. The schooner waited for them just beyond,
through the mist.</p>

<p class='c018'>There had been no time to say good-by. Marie
Josephine dashed the tears from her eyes, leaning
forward.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Dian,” she called softly. “Dian, Dian, Dian!”
Then she took the faded gold flower, which she had
gathered on the hill road a few hours before, from
the belt of her dirty smock and threw it toward the
shore. It fell at Dian’s feet, where he stood with
Jean and Grigge close beside him.</p>

<p class='c018'>
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_351' id='Page_351'>351</a></span>
“You will come back, all of you, Little Mademoiselle,”
he said. In his eyes was the light which they
all knew so well; not even the mist could hide it.
He stooped and picked up the flower. It was a lily
of France.</p>
